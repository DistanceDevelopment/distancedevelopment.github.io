The Distance project provides software for the design and analysis of distance sampling surveys of wildlife populations. This software takes two forms: a Windows-based program and a suite of R packages. This site is hosted by the [Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling](https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/) at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/).
