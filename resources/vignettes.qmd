Over time we have developed a number of examples, or case studies to help users experience how to use the R packages we have developed to perform a number of common tasks. Feel free to use the code provided as templates forming the starting point for your own analysis.

Buttons (e.g. `Line transect`) can be clicked to filter the examples. Reload the page to remove filter.

In addition to these, there are several more case studies not associated with specific R packages. Those case studies can be found at the website associated with the book [Buckland et al. (2015)](https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/software/ds-manda/)
