  abstract = {Populations of the Mojave Desert Tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) experienced severe declines in abundance in the decades leading up to 1990, when the species was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Population responses to recovery efforts have not been well documented because of the difficulties of studying this low-density, cryptic species over a time period appropriate to its long generation time. We used line distance sampling to estimate annual adult densities since 1999 in Utah and since 2004 elsewhere in the range of Mojave Desert Tortoises. We used generalized least squares regression on log-transformed adult tortoise densities to estimate annual percentage change through 2014 in each of 17 Tortoise Conservation Areas (TCAs) in the five recovery units. We report annual proportional increases in density of adults in the Northeastern Mojave Recovery Unit, but declines in the other four recovery units. Adjusting these densities and trends for the area of potential habitat in each recovery unit, we estimated that in 2004 there were 336,393 adult tortoises (standard error [SE] = 51,596), with an overall loss of 124,050 adult tortoises (SE = 36,062) by 2014. The proportion of juveniles in our surveys has been decreasing in all five recovery units since 2007. Prevailing declines in the abundance of adults overall and in four of the five recovery units indicate the need for more aggressive implementation of recovery actions and more critical evaluation of the suite of future activities and projects in tortoise habitat that may exacerbate ongoing population declines.},

The use of camera trapping as a survey tool for medium and large terrestrial mammals has become increasingly common, especially in forest habitats. Here, we applied the distance sampling method to images generated from camera-trap surveys in Dja Faunal Reserve, Cameroon, and used an estimate of the proportion of time animals are active to correct for negative bias in the density estimates from the 24-hour camera-trap survey datasets. We also used multiple covariate distance sampling with body weight as a covariate to estimate detection probabilities and densities of rarer species. These methods provide an effective tool for monitoring the status of individual species or a community of forest antelope species, information urgently needed for conservation planning and action.},

  abstract = {Knowing the abundance of a population is a crucial component to assess its conservation status and develop effective conservation plans. For most cetaceans, abundance estimation is difficult given their cryptic and mobile nature, especially when the population is small and has a transnational distribution. In the Baltic Sea, the number of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) has collapsed since the mid-20th century and the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN and HELCOM; however, its abundance remains unknown. Here, one of the largest ever passive acoustic monitoring studies was carried out by eight Baltic Sea nations to estimate the abundance of the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise for the first time. By logging porpoise echolocation signals at 298 stations during May 2011\textendash April 2013, calibrating the loggers' spatial detection performance at sea, and measuring the click rate of tagged individuals, we estimated an abundance of 71\textendash 1105 individuals (95\% CI, point estimate 491) during May\textendash October within the population's proposed management border. The small abundance estimate strongly supports that the Baltic Proper harbour porpoise is facing an extremely high risk of extinction, and highlights the need for immediate and efficient conservation actions through international cooperation. It also provides a starting point in monitoring the trend of the population abundance to evaluate the effectiveness of management measures and determine its interactions with the larger neighboring Belt Sea population. Further, we offer evidence that design-based passive acoustic monitoring can generate reliable estimates of the abundance of rare and cryptic animal populations across large spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Ensuring that inferences from biological monitoring are reliable requires a level of sampling effort that is commensurate with programmatic objectives and reflects attributes of target populations. Consensus guidelines have emerged to guide allocation of sampling effort for programmes designed to detect trends in occupancy but not for abundance, despite its prevalence as a target parameter. We evaluated the influence of population attributes (density, availability, detection probability and magnitude of trend) and sampling design features (number of sites, number of repeat surveys, and survey-year interval) on a Bayesian analogue of statistical power to detect declines in abundance estimated using distance sampling methods. For a range of values common to terrestrial vertebrates, we simulated spatially and temporally replicated populations from which we generated survey data. We then analysed each dataset with a hierarchical open-population model that allowed for temporary emigration to estimate power for periods of 5\textendash 20 years. For a given amount of sampling effort, power to detect trends was highest when effort was allocated to maximizing the number of sites by decreasing the number of repeat surveys within a year and increasing the interval between survey years. For example, to have an 80\% chance of detecting a 3\% annual decline required 40\% longer when 67 sites were surveyed three times per year compared to 600 sites surveyed once every three years despite both allocations requiring 4,000 surveys over 20 years. Notably, these patterns were independent of density or detectability of the target species, which contrasts with occupancy studies where optimal allocation shifts from surveying more sites to more repeat surveys when detectability is low or occupancy is high. Synthesis and applications. Our findings provide guidance for allocating resources efficiently for distance sampling studies focused on terrestrial vertebrates. By comparing the approximate density and detectability of target populations to those we considered, monitoring programmes can balance the amount of survey effort allocated to sites, surveys per site, and annual revisits to help ensure sufficient power to meet objectives effectively and efficiently. These decisions are increasingly important as budgets for conservation decrease and consequences of inaction continue to increase.},

  abstract    = {\textexclamdown p\textquestiondown Indices of relative abundance do not control for variation in detectability, which can bias density estimates such that ecological processes are difficult to infer. Distance sampling methods can be used to correct for detectability, but in rainforest, where dense vegetation and diverse assemblages complicate sampling, information is lacking about factors affecting their application. Rare species present an additional challenge, as data may be too sparse to fit detection functions. We present analyses of distance sampling data collected for a diverse tropical rainforest bird assemblage across broad elevational and latitudinal gradients in North Queensland, Australia. Using audio and visual detections, we assessed the influence of various factors on Effective Strip Width (ESW), an intuitively useful parameter, since it can be used to calculate an estimate of density from count data. Body size and species exerted the most important influence on ESW, with larger species detectable over greater distances than smaller species. Secondarily, wet weather and high shrub density decreased ESW for most species. ESW for several species also differed between summer and winter, possibly due to seasonal differences in calling behavior. Distance sampling proved logistically intensive in these environments, but large differences in ESW between species confirmed the need to correct for detection probability to obtain accurate density estimates. Our results suggest an evidence-based approach to controlling for factors influencing detectability, and avenues for further work including modeling detectability as a function of species characteristics such as body size and call characteristics. Such models may be useful in developing a calibration for non-distance sampling data and for estimating detectability of rare species.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown},

  abstract    = {In the Southern Hemisphere, humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were heavily exploited from both coastal stations and in pelagic waters in all major ocean basins. About 200,000 whales were taken after 1900, causing declines of populations to small percentages of their pre-exploitation levels. The study presented here aimed to investigate humpback whale abundance in the Brazilian coastal breeding ground, in order to provide information to support further analysis of the population recovery. Between 25 August and 2 September 2001, a fixed wing, flat window, aircraft was used to survey transect lines along the northern limit of Bahia State (12\textdegree 10'S), to the southern limit of Esp\'irito Santo State (20\textdegree 42'S). All on-effort sightings were recorded and abundance was estimated according to standard distance sampling methodology (Burnham et al., 1980; Buckland et al., 1993). Group sizes of humpback whales ranged between 1-5 and the mean group size was 1.52 ({$\pm$}0.06). The model that best fitted the perpendicular distance data, based on the minimum Akaike Information Criterion, was the hazard rate model. The population size estimated using uncorrected data was 1,493 (CV=0.21) whales. Surface time was used to correct the estimates for g\textasciicircum{} (0), resulting in a correction factor of 0.67 ({$\pm$}0.15). The corrected analysis for each block and combined result, increased the population size estimate to 2,229 (CV=0.31) individuals. The data from this study could be used to identify new areas appropriate for whalewatching, to monitor the status and dynamics of the humpback whale population off the Brazilian coast and to provide information for the establishment of new protected areas},

  abstract = {Reliable estimates of population size and a knowledge of determinants of detectability and density estimates are crucial for effective conservation of species. Using Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS), we modelled the influence of covariates on detection probability and density estimates of native blackbuck Antilope cervicapra and the invasive feral-horse Equus caballus at Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary. Grids of 1\,\texttimes\,1~km size were overlaid on the study area with a 1-km line transect in alternate grid cells. Sixteen transects were walked four times each, which detected 199 blackbuck and 152 feral-horse clusters. On each sighting, the climatic, habitat and anthropogenic covariates were recorded, which are likely to affect detection probability. At first, exploratory analyses were made using Conventional Distance Sampling (CDS) to arrive at estimates. Later, in Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS), key models were fit into the dataset after selecting the potential covariates that had a significant effect on detection distances obtained from FAMD/PCA, and the best one was selected based on AIC. The MCDS analysis in blackbuck included covariates, viz., distance to water in the best model (29 individuals/km2; CI\,22\textendash 36; detection probability\,=\,0.58), followed by distance to feral-horse, sampling time and principal diet. The covariate distance to water emerged as the best model for feral-horse as well (13 individuals/km2; CI\,9\textendash 18; detection probability\,=\,0.36), followed by distance to cattle and principal diet. While the MCDS approach outperformed the CDS global and survey-strata estimates in blackbuck, both the approaches had a marginal difference in feral-horse. Post-stratification analysis showed that blackbuck density increased significantly with distance to water and feral-horse, but insignificantly with the absence of principal diet; whereas, the density of the feral-horse increased significantly with distance to water and cattle in the presence of principal diet. These findings suggest the ability of feral-horse to keep the blackbuck away from optimal areas, where the principal diet is abundant. Our study, thus, illustrates the need for the use of MCDS approach that ascertained (i) reliable population density estimates, (ii) spatiotemporal constraint on large herbivores caused by overabundance of water during the wet season, and (iii) competitive interaction of the invasive feral-horse with the native blackbuck and its likely effect on the latter keeping away from the former and the principal diet to overcome competition. Thus, the study highlights the impact of feral-horse on the native species and suggests measures for the long-term conservation of the blackbuck.},

To evaluate the abundance and distribution of Balearic Shearwaters in Portuguese Continental Shelf Waters, during the post-breeding period when migrating birds are outside the Mediterranean Sea, we conducted 5 aerial surveys between 2010 and 2014 (21 survey days covering 62,716\^A km2). Following a line transect method, observers recorded a total of 181 Balearic Shearwaters sightings. Using Distance sampling software, we estimated an overall species abundance (2010\textendash 2014) of 10,182, ranging between 2338 in 2010 and 23,221 individuals in 2012. During the 2012 post-breeding period, the Portuguese Continental Shelf Waters were used by up to 96.8\% of the latest migratory population assessment. Considering Balearic Shearwater estimates per sampling block, there was a preference for the North and Center sectors of the Portuguese coast (respectively, 7058 and 1366 individuals) where several SPAs were already designated. We computed the annual and overall habitat predictive models for Balearic Shearwaters using a maximum entropy algorithm on MaxEnt software. In all models, the Balearic shearwater distribution was best predicted by mean chlorophyll concentration. Balearic Shearwaters are mostly present in shallow shelf and coastal waters particularly in the widest portions of the continental shelf. These areas are strongly influenced by upwelling, which concurs with the chlorophyll concentration being the most important predicting variable. Portuguese Continental Shelf Waters are one of the most important post-breeding grounds to the Balearic Shearwater.},

  abstract    = {The Montserrat Oriole Icterus oberi is endemic to the Caribbean island of Montserrat where, prior to 1995, it was widely distributed across the island's three main interior mountain ranges: the Centre, Soufriere and South Soufriere Hills. In July 1995, a long-dormant volcano on Chances Peak in the Soufriere Hills began to erupt. Since then the forest habitat of the oriole on the Soufriere and South Soufriere Hills has been devastated by pyroclastic flows and surges, heavy ash eruptions and rock falls. The Montserrat Oriole populations that inhabited these two mountain ranges have probably been lost. In December 1997, a census of the remaining Centre Hills population was undertaken to assess its status in the face of the heavy ash fall that occurred earlier the same year. To do this, a systematic grid of 140 sample points was overlaid on an area of 1,437{$\cdot$}5 ha encompassing the Centre Hills, and a 10-minute count of all bird species was undertaken at 137 of these points during an eight-day survey period. The distance from the point to each oriole detected was measured and records of all other species were allocated to one of five distance bands radiating out from the point. Distance sampling was used to model densities, and thus to estimate population sizes, of eight bird species in the study area. It was estimated that 4,000 (95\% CIs 1,500-7,800) Montserrat Orioles remain in the Centre Hills and thus the world. Although the probability of pyroclastic flows and surges overrunning the Centre Hills is considered remote, it is recommended that the Montserrat Oriole be classified as Globally Threatened (Endangered) under the revised IUCN threat categories because of its loss of breeding habitat since 1995.},

With a single-scan setup, there will be a nondetection of trees in a plot and the representation of the individual trees will be incomplete. We explore how stand-level volume estimates, based on the single-scan mode, perform compared with standard inventory estimates. We base our study on 166 plots in 12 mature stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) in southern Norway. First, we compare individual-tree volume estimates from TLS with estimates from volume functions and measurements from harvesters. We show that individual-tree volumes can be estimated with high precision and accuracy with TLS in single-scan mode. Secondly, we test three approaches for correction of nondetection relying on model-based estimates of the detection probability obtained by point transect sampling estimators. We show that all three approaches adjust for nondetection and yield stand-level volume estimates that are similar to those obtained by fixed-area sampling. In conclusion, our results indicate that stand-level volume estimates, based on single-scan mode TLS data, perform well compared with standard inventory estimates.},

Furthermore, few regional-level surveys have been conducted because of difficulties in sampling in the complex landscape of Sonoran Desert upland habitat. We used distance-sampling to document macrohabitat use and regional density of Desert Tortoises across the 76,800-ha Ironwood Forest National Monument in Arizona. We observed 42 tortoises on transects, and distance sampling produced an estimate of 17,997 tortoises ? 150 mm carapace length (coefficient of variation = 41.5\%) on the monument. Stratification by habitat type (steep topography with boulders, incised washes, or neither of these components) improved precision slightly (37.2\%). Detection probability contributed least to density variance, compared to encounter rate and tortoise detectability on the transect line, indicating that assumptions of the technique were met during sampling. We found tortoises or their sign on 92\% of transects in boulder habitat, on 71\% that included incised washes, and on 25\% in habitat with neither of these features (up to 1.7 km away from the nearest slope). Our results indicate that Desert Tortoises in the Sonoran Desert occur at low density, but are not absent, from intermountain valleys, and the maintenance of these valleys for tortoise movement between local populations may be important for long-term population viability. With this in mind, concentrating survey effort in areas with steep topography and boulders will increase tortoise encounter rate, result in better precision of regional density and trend estimates, and may also reduce survey effort.},

We studied density, body condition, and survivorship of Neotropical migrants, with emphasis on cerulean warbler (Dendroica cerulea), in primary forest and shade coffee plantations in Venezuela. We worked in three primary forest sites and three shade coffee plantations on the western slope of the Cordillera de M\~A\textcopyright rida of the Andes Mountains. At each site, we surveyed migrants with distance-based line transects and mist-netted and banded migrants during November-February 2005/06 and 2006/07. In addition, we estimated apparent monthly survival for cerulean warbler based on 29 color-banded individuals. Densities of migrants were 3-14\~A\textemdash{} higher in shade coffee plantations than primary forest sites, even after accounting for differences in detectability. Apparent monthly survival of cerulean warblers was estimated at 97\% and overwinter persistence was similarly high. In addition, cerulean warblers demonstrated high between-season fidelity, with 65\% of the birds banded the first year being resighted during the second year. Interestingly, immature birds returned at nearly half the rate as did adults. Banding data indicated that body condition increased significantly as the season progressed for cerulean warblers, Tennessee warblers (Vermivora peregrina), and American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla). Collectively, these data provide evidence that shade coffee plantations offer high quality wintering habitat for Neotropical migrants, including cerulean warblers.},

We discuss its properties of interest, including the shapes of the model and the corresponding probability density function, moments, and the related sub-detection model. Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is considered. Subsequently, an application is carried out to the proposed model based on a practical data set of perpendicular distances. It is compared with some classical and recent models based on the evaluation of some goodness-of-fit statistics. As results, the variance-covariance matrix, confidence intervals of the parameters and estimated population abundance of the data set are obtained under the proposed detection model.},

  abstract    = {Guanacos (Lama guanicoe) are the only wild ungulate species widely distributed across the Patagonian steppe and have undergone a precipitous population decline since the introduction of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) 100 years ago. There has been speculation that sheep ranching may have played a major role in guanaco population decline after monopolising the most productive land because of competition for forage plants. Our aim in this work was to estimate guanaco abundance and account for its variation across nine different sites, two seasons and two years. We conducted over 100 ground surveys of both guanacos and sheep and estimated the availability of the preferred plant species both animal species might select in their diet. We found that (1) sheep densities were up to 23 times higher than guanaco densities in sympatric conditions, (2) at a protected site without sheep, guanaco density was one order of magnitude higher than at the rest of the sites, (3) across nine different sites, sheep densities alone accounted for around 60\% of the variation in guanaco abundance, (4) guanaco densities were negatively related to both total plant cover and availability of the preferred plant species in their diet, which were both positively associated with sheep density, and (5) within-site changes in guanaco densities between seasons and years were negatively related to changes in sheep densities. Our results are consistent with predictions on interspecific competition for food resources, although we cannot rule out possible effects of other human-related activities influencing guanaco abundance. We conclude that sheep compete with guanacos for forage in arid Patagonia.},

  abstract    = {Using field data from brushtail possums \emph{(Trichosurus vulpecula)}, we present a method for modelling wildlife detection probabilities. Whereas detection functions typically (e.g. for distance sampling) describe the probability of direct human observations of animal subjects, we adapted this approach for cryptic species where observation depends on animals being caught in traps. Specifically, we characterised the probability of individual brushtail possums being caught by leg-hold traps in an area of farmland and native forest in New Zealand. Detection probability was defined as the per-individual, per-trap, per-night probability of a possum being captured, and was modelled as a function of home-range utilisation. Radio-telemetry was used to define the home-range distributions of 18 possums, and a combination of scanning radio-receivers and movement-activated video-cameras recorded instances when radio-collared possums encountered and stepped on the trigger of leg-hold traps (inactivated by being wired open). We estimated a 5\% chance of trapping individual possums with a single leg-hold trap located in the centre of their home range for one night (median value across possums). Furthermore, this probability decreased rapidly as a function of distance, so that at 120 m from the centre of the home range there was less than a 1\% chance of trapping success per possum per night. The techniques developed in this study could be applied to a wide variety of species and sampling methods. \textcopyright{} CSIRO 2005.},

  abstract    = {The chiru or Tibetan antelope \emph{Pantholops hodgsoni} has dramatically decreased in number over recent decades, and efficient monitoring of the density and distribution of chiru is vital to the management of this endangered species. We evaluated line transect sampling methodology, using track and cross-county transects, and assessed its conformity to underlying assumptions for use in estimating density of chiru in the ca 2,300 km2 Aru Basin, Tibet. Although violations of some assumptions were apparent, they were generally not substantial, and simple adjustments of sampling design can reduce their effects in future surveys. Sampling effort was not sufficient to demonstrate clear seasonal differences in chiru density between summer and autumn. However, cross-country transects on the west side of the study area did show a statistically significant higher autumn than summer density, and encounter rates (the number of detections per km) were significantly higher for both transect types in autumn. We tested for an expected negative bias associated with track transects, and although a clear difference in estimated density was not found, a significantly higher encounter rate was present for cross-country than for track transects. With increased sampling effort and a more effective design in future surveys, line transect sampling will be a useful methodology for assessment of chiru populations. \textcopyright{} Wildlife Biology (2006).},

  abstract    = {Cetacean abundance is estimated for the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Hawaiian Islands based on a ship line-transect survey from August to November, 2002. Sighting detection functions are estimated from this and other NOAA research surveys from 1986 to 2002 using a new, multiple-covariate approach. Twenty-four species were seen on this survey, including two species (Fraser's dolphin [Lagenodelphis hosei] and sei whale [Balaenoptera borealis]) that had not been previously documented to occur in Hawaiian waters. The most abundant large whales are sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni). The most abundant delphinids are pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis), Fraser's dolphins, spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata), and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). Dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and Kogia breviceps) and Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) are also estimated to be quite abundant. Some of the migratory baleen whales (fin whales [Balaenoptera physalus], sei whales, minke whales [B. acutorostrata], and humpback whales [Megaptera novaeangliae]) were seen only late in the survey. Abundance is estimated for 19 cetacean species. The overall density of cetaceans is low in the study area, especially for delphinids. The precision of density and abundance estimates is generally low for all species because of the low number of sightings. \textcopyright{} 2006 the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

  abstract    = {As part of the EU-funded project "CLUSTER" a database was constructed of herring schools identified during a series of acoustic surveys in the northwest North Sea. Among other descriptors, the database included each schools' height, length, and acoustic backscattering energy (Sa). The number of schools per nautical mile. EDSU (Elementary Distance Sampling Unit) was also recorded. The relationships between local school count and school backscattering energy to time-of-day and location were first modelled using multiple regression techniques. The results indicate a considerable degree of non-linear dependency on both time-of-day and location. Herring-school counts per EDSU tended to be high during the middle part of the day and lower at dawn and dusk and were higher along the continental shelf edge about 130 m west of Orkney and Shetland. The regression models, by definition, also allow variability due to each explanatory variable to be assayed and divided. This feature meant that their output could be used to explore further into the relationships among the schools. In this paper the residual variability from the regression models is used to describe density-dependent relationships among herring schools, i.e. we asked "To what extent does local herring school abundance influence the size (backscattering energy) of a given school?" It is concluded that herring school size is regulated mainly by location and time-of-day and that \&quot;measured\&quot; school size is not influenced by the local "school count per EDSU". The results and their implications are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract    = {We conducted at-sea line transect surveys for Marbled Murrelets \emph{(Brachyramphus marmoratus)} to determine density off the coast of central California and to explore the utility of various survey protocols. Surveys were designed to compare line versus strip transect methods, and reveal the effects of distance from shore, viewing conditions and seasonal trends on density estimates. On consecutive days, we conducted 12 paired (24 total) at-sea line and strip transect surveys that were 20 km long at 400 m and 800 m from shore. We also performed nine surveys that were 10 km long and at distances of 400 m. 900 m, 1.400 m, 2,400 m, 3,400 m and 4.400 m from shore. Density estimates calculated using line transects were significantly greater than estimates based on strip transects of 100 m and 200 m widths. Marbled Murrelet density ranged from 2.4-39.4 birds km-2 at 400 m from shore, and from 0.0-16.5 birds km-2 at 800 m from shore. Density was higher on the 400 m than on the 800 m survey on 22 of 24 survey days. Densities measured on consecutive days were highly correlated on the 400 m transect but not on the 800 m transect. Line transect densities on the 400 m transect were higher when conducted under better viewing conditions. Line transects had higher statistical power to detect trends than strip transects. Statistical power analyses indicated only a 24\% chance of detecting a population declining by 5\% per year over 5 years when surveying line transects 20 km in length five times a year. Power to detect a 5\% annual change increased to 57\% when surveying line transects five times per year over 10 years. Survey design should strive to minimize variability in bird density in order to maximize likelihood of detecting population trends. An increase in the number of surveys per breeding season, length of a transect, or duration of monitoring effort should increase power to detect trends in murrelet density. We suggest that at-sea surveys should focus on detecting trends in density rather than population size.},

  abstract   = {Surveying cryptic, nocturnal animals is logistically challenging. Consequently, density estimates may be imprecise and uncertain. Survey innovations mitigate ecological and observational difficulties contributing to estimation variance. Thus, comparisons of survey techniques are critical to evaluate estimates of abundance. We simultaneously compared three methods for observing mountain hare Lepus timidus using Distance sampling to estimate abundance. Daylight visual surveys achieved 41 detections, estimating density at 14.3 hares km\textendash 2 (95\%CI 6.3\textendash 32.5) resulting in the lowest estimate and widest confidence interval. Night-time thermal imaging achieved 206 detections, estimating density at 12.1 hares km\textendash 2 (95\%CI 7.6\textendash 19.4). Thermal imaging captured more observations at furthest distances, and detected larger group sizes. Camera traps achieved 3705 night-time detections, estimating density at 22.6 hares km\textendash 2 (95\%CI 17.1\textendash 29.9). Between the methods, detections were spatially correlated, although the estimates of density varied. Our results suggest that daylight visual surveys tended to underestimate density, failing to reflect nocturnal activity. Thermal imaging captured nocturnal activity, providing a higher detection rate, but required fine weather. Camera traps captured nocturnal activity, and operated 24/7 throughout harsh weather, but needed careful consideration of empirical assumptions. We discuss the merits and limitations of each method with respect to the estimation of population density in the field.},

  abstract = {Population abundance and density estimates provide key information for conservation assessment and prioritization of efforts and management. However, data are still largely unavailable for many taxa, including sea snakes, which appear to be facing global declines. Here, we present the first quantitative abundance and density estimates for the geographically isolated sea snake Hydrophis platurus xanthos endemic to the inner basin of Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica. Using systematic distance sampling methods, we obtained and analyzed 199 snake detections from 46 transect lines covering the entire known distribution (totaling nine days and 469~km of effort). Our modeling methods accounted for (i) the probability of detecting a snake given it was available to be detected (ii) the average availability of snakes at the water surface during a 24-hr cycle, and (iii) the by-hour variance in the taxon's activity pattern. The best estimate of population abundance was 29781 individuals (95\% CI=20104\textendash 44115) with an estimated density of 76 snakes/km2. Without historical abundance estimates or minimum viable population size, it is unknown whether this number represents a healthy population. However, with all individuals inhabiting a relatively small inlet increasingly exposed to anthropogenic impacts, the long-term persistence of H. p. xanthos may be threatened by ongoing impacts (boat propeller strikes, agricultural runoff, and climate change), as well as unforeseen events in the future.},

We deployed 160 camera traps (CTs) systematically over 743 locations covering 17,127 km2 of evergreen lowland rainforest of Salonga National Park, block South, Democratic Republic of the Congo. We evaluated the applicability of CT distance sampling (CTDS) to species different in size and behaviour. To improve precision of estimates, we evaluated two methods estimating species' availability (`A') for detection by CTs. We recorded 16,700 video clips, revealing 43 different animal taxa. We estimated densities of 14 species differing in physical, behavioural and ecological traits, and extracted species-specific availability from available video footage using two methods (a) `ACa' (Cappelle et al. [2019] Am. J. Primatol., 81, e22962) and (b) `ARo' (Rowcliffe et al. [2014] Methods Ecol. Evol. 5, 1170). With sample sizes being large enough, we found minor differences between ACa and ARo in estimated densities. In contrast, low detectability and reactivity to the camera were main sources of bias. CTDS proved efficient for estimating density of homogenously rather than patchily distributed species. Synthesis and applications. Our application of camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) to a diverse vertebrate community demonstrates the enormous potential of this methodology for surveys of terrestrial wildlife, allowing rapid assessments of species' status and trends that can translate into effective conservation strategies. By providing the first estimates of understudied species such as the Congo peafowl, the giant ground pangolin and the cusimanses, CTDS may be used as a tool to revise these species' conservation status in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Based on the constraints we encountered, we identify improvements to the current application, enhancing the general applicability of this method.},

  abstract   = {Habitat destruction and over-hunting are increasingly threatening the arboreal primates of Central Africa. To establish effective conservation strategies, accurate assessments of primate density, abundance, and spatial distribution are required. To date, the method of choice for primate density estimation is line transect distance sampling. However, primates fleeing human observers violate methodological assumptions, biasing the accuracy of resulting estimates. In this study, we used line transect distance sampling to study five primate species along 378~km of transects in Salonga National Park, Democratic Republic of the Congo. We tested the effect of different levels of survey-inherent disturbance (i.e., cutting) on the number of observed (i) primate groups, and (ii) individuals within groups, by counting groups at three different time lags after disturbance of the transect, (i) a minimum of 3~h, (ii) 24~h, (iii) a minimum of 3~days. We found that survey-inherent disturbance led to underestimated densities, affecting both the number of encountered groups and of observed individuals. However, the response varied between species due to species-specific ecological and behavioral features. Piliocolobus tholloni and Colobus angolenis resumed an unaltered behavior only 24~h after disturbance, while Lophocebus aterrimus, Cercopithecus ascanius, and Cercopithecus wolfi required a minimum of 10~days. To minimize bias in density estimates, future surveys using line transect distance sampling should be designed considering survey-inherent disturbance. We recommend evaluating the factors driving primate response, including habitat type, niche occupation, and hunting pressure, peculiar to the survey-specific area and primate community under study.},

  abstract    = {Vertebrate population densities were quantified in lowland central Guyana using line-transect censuses at three forest sites subjected to reduced-impact logging (RIL), and three adjacent unlogged sites. We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4\^A km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416\^A km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9\^A m3\^A ha-1, equivalent to only 1.1\^A trees\^A ha-1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests.},

  abstract  = {Informed conservation management of marine mammals requires an understanding of population size and habitat preferences. In Australia, such data are needed for the assessment and mitigation of anthropogenic impacts, including fisheries interactions, coastal zone developments, oil and gas exploration and mining activities. Here, we present large-scale estimates of abundance, density and habitat preferences of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) over an area of 42,438km2 within two gulfs of South Australia. Using double-observer platform aerial surveys over four strata and mark-recapture distance sampling analyses, we estimated 3,493 (CV\,=\,0.21; 95\%CI\,=\,2,327-5,244) dolphins in summer/autumn, and 3,213 (CV\,=\,0.20; 95\%CI\,=\,2,151-4,801) in winter/spring of 2011. Bottlenose dolphin abundance and density was higher in gulf waters across both seasons (0.09-0.24 dolphins/km2) compared to adjacent shelf waters (0.004\textendash 0.04 dolphins/km2). The high densities of bottlenose dolphins in the two gulfs highlight the importance of these gulfs as a habitat for the species. Habitat modelling associated bottlenose dolphins with shallow waters, flat seafloor topography, and higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in summer/autumn and lower SSTs in winter/spring. Spatial predictions showed high dolphin densities in northern and coastal gulf sections. Distributional data should inform management strategies, marine park planning and environmental assessments of potential anthropogenic threats to this protected species.},

The density estimates were based on nest counts. The strip transect census and the line transect survey method (Standing Crop Nest Count) were used to estimate the gorilla nest group density. The strip transect has been most commonly used to date. It assumes that all nest groups within the width of the strip are detected, but as this assumption is easily violated in the dense tropical rain forest, the line transect survey was also used. In this method, only the nest groups on the transect line itself should be detected. This method proved to be an adequate and easy technique for estimating animal densities in dense vegetation. The gorilla density of 1.6 individuals km-2 (line transect survey method) found for the Dzanga sector is one of the highest densities ever reported in the literature for the Western lowland gorilla. The density estimate for chimpanzees was 0.16 individuals km-2 (census method). The results of this study confirm the importance of the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park for primate conservation.},

  abstract    = {Finite population sampling theory is useful in estimating total population size (abundance) from abundance estimates of each sampled unit (quadrat). We develop estimators that allow correlated quadrat abundance estimates, even for quadrats in different sampling strata. Correlated quadrat abundance estimates based on mark-recapture or distance sampling methods occur when data are pooled across quadrats to estimate, for example, capture probability parameters or sighting functions. When only minimal information is available from each quadrat, pooling of data across quadrats may be necessary to efficiently estimate capture probabilities or sighting functions. We further include information from a quadrat-based auxiliary variable to more precisely estimate total population size via a ratio estimator. We also provide variance estimators for the difference between or the ratio of 2 abundance estimates, taken at different times. We present an example based on estimating the number of Mexican spotted owls \emph{(Strix occidentalis lucida)} in the Upper Gila Mountains Recovery Unit, Arizona and New Mexico, USA. Owl abundance for each quadrat was estimated with a Huggins 4-pass mark-resight population estimator, but with initial capture and resighting probabilities modeled in common across all sample quadrats. Pooling mark-resight data across quadrats was necessary because few owls were marked on individual quadrats to estimate quadrat-specific capture probabilities. Model-based estimates of owl abundance for each quadrat necessitated variance estimation procedures that take into account correlated quadrat estimates. An auxiliary variable relating to topographic roughness of sampled quadrats provided a useful covariate for a ratio estimator.},

  abstract    = {\textexclamdown p\textquestiondown For biological populations that form aggregations (or clusters) of individuals, cluster size is an important parameter in line-transect abundance estimation and should be accurately measured. Cluster size in cetaceans has traditionally been represented as the total number of individuals in a group, but group size may be underestimated if group members are spatially diffuse. Groups of false killer whales (\textexclamdown italic\textquestiondown Pseudorca crassidens\textexclamdown/italic\textquestiondown ) can comprise numerous subgroups that are dispersed over tens of kilometers, leading to a spatial mismatch between a detected group and the theoretical framework of line-transect analysis. Three stocks of false killer whales are found within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone of the Hawaiian Islands (Hawaiian EEZ): an insular main Hawaiian Islands stock, a pelagic stock, and a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) stock. A ship-based line-transect survey of the Hawaiian EEZ was conducted in the summer and fall of 2010, resulting in six systematic-effort visual sightings of pelagic (\textexclamdown italic\textquestiondown n\textexclamdown/italic\textquestiondown\^a\texteuro\v{S}=\^a\texteuro\v{S}5) and NWHI (\textexclamdown italic\textquestiondown n\textexclamdown/italic\textquestiondown\^a\texteuro\v{S}=\^a\texteuro\v{S}1) false killer whale groups. The maximum number and spatial extent of subgroups per sighting was 18 subgroups and 35 km, respectively. These sightings were combined with data from similar previous surveys and analyzed within the conventional line-transect estimation framework. The detection function, mean cluster size, and encounter rate were estimated separately to appropriately incorporate data collected using different methods. Unlike previous line-transect analyses of cetaceans, subgroups were treated as the analytical cluster instead of groups because subgroups better conform to the specifications of line-transect theory. Bootstrap values (\textexclamdown italic\textquestiondown n\textexclamdown/italic\textquestiondown\^a\texteuro\v{S}=\^a\texteuro\v{S}5,000) of the line-transect parameters were randomly combined to estimate the variance of stock-specific abundance estimates.

  abstract = {Spatially explicit estimates of population density, together with appropriate estimates of uncertainty, are required in many management contexts. Density surface models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach for estimating spatially varying density from distance sampling data. First, detection probabilities\textemdash perhaps depending on covariates\textemdash are estimated based on details of individual encounters; next, local densities are estimated using a GAM, by fitting local encounter rates to location and/or spatially varying covariates while allowing for the estimated detectabilities. One criticism of DSMs has been that uncertainty from the two stages is not usually propagated correctly into the final variance estimates. We show how to reformulate a DSM so that the uncertainty in detection probability from the distance sampling stage (regardless of its complexity) is captured as an extra random effect in the GAM stage. In effect, we refit an approximation to the detection function model at the same time as fitting the spatial model. This allows straightforward computation of the overall variance via exactly the same software already needed to fit the GAM. A further extension allows for spatial variation in group size, which can be an important covariate for detectability as well as directly affecting abundance. We illustrate these models using point transect survey data of Island Scrub-Jays on Santa Cruz Island, CA, and harbour porpoise from the SCANS-II line transect survey of European waters.

  abstract = {Understanding the ecological factors influencing African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) abundance and distribution is crucial for their conservation management in Central Africa. Dung surveys have been conducted at the landscape scale and confirmed the overwhelming impact of anthropogenic activities on forest elephants. We present results from a small-scale survey in a pristine protected area without anthropogenic activities to elucidate the ecological factors influencing forest elephant density. We conducted a line transect dung survey in a small study area (110 km2) around Mbeli Bai, a natural forest clearing in the Nouabal\'e-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo, and compare results with a landscape survey conducted during the same period. We used habitat specific dung decay data collected on site to estimate elephant density using distance sampling. We fitted Generalized Additive Models to elephant dung encounter rate using explanatory variables collected during the transect survey and from geospatial data. The small-scale survey revealed a precise estimate of forest elephant density that was twice as high as the result from a landscape survey with higher density in mixed species forest for the small-scale survey. We could not find an impact of the proximity of forest clearings and proximity to rivers at the small scale. Fine-scale habitat features, e.g. degree of canopy and understorey closure, had little explanatory power for elephant dung encounter rate. Small-scale dung surveys are a useful method to reveal spatio-temporal variation in forest elephant density and distribution which can inform conservation practitioners in a timely manner. Combining monitoring methods at various spatial scales improves our knowledge and conservation efforts of forest elephants. Nouabal\'e-Ndoki National Park is a stronghold for forest elephants and of global importance for their conservation.},

The estimators and accompanying standard error expressions are tractable and easy to calculate, and, coming from likelihood methods, often will have high efficiency. Such properties compare favourably with those of existing K-function methods which however are semiparametric in nature and less reliant on specific parametric assumptions. The likelihood analysis reveals auxiliary information which could be used to check the form of the detection function.},

For monitoring Karner blue butterflies in Wisconsin, USA, comparable estimates are required because each year a different selection of sites will be monitored. Annual state-wide indices of species abundance can be derived from the site-surveys and compared to previous year's indices to monitor trends. We advocate that line transect sampling is preferable to Pollard-Yates transects as a survey technique for monitoring Karner blue butterflies. The Pollard-Yates surveys do not adjust for differences in site detectability. As a consequence, estimates of among-site from Pollard-Yates surveys can be biased. \textcopyright{} 1998 Chapman \& Hall.},

  abstract    = {The Mallee Emu-wren (Stipiturus mallee) is a threatened, narrow-range passerine endemic to south-eastern Australia. To inform future conservation measures for this poorly known species, we used ecological niche factor analysis, habitat suitability modelling and distance sampling to determine landscape-scale habitat requirements and estimate the population size. Using GIS software, we integrated digital layers of ecogeographic variables with; (1) presence-only observations to derive and validate a habitat suitability model using ecological niche factor analysis, and (2) distance sampling to determine population distribution and densities across vegetation types. We detected populations in only five of seven reserves which they had occupied in 2000. We estimate the global population size to be 16,821 individuals (range 8431-39, 104), 68\% greater than the previously estimated 10,000 individuals, with a single large reserve containing the majority ( 92\%) of the global population. The Mallee Emu-wren is a habitat specialist, primarily occurring in mallee-Triodia vegetation that has not been burnt for at least 15 years. The highest densities were in vegetation associations containing at least a 15\% cover of Triodia, however, time since the habitat was last burnt was the overriding factor in determining densities. Large-scale wildfires are a pervasive threat to the global status of the Mallee Emu-wren, and the risk to remaining populations is exacerbated by the adverse impact of prolonged drought and the potential for altered fire regimes caused by global warming. Evaluation of the global population status, and the continued wildfire threat warranted recent reclassification of the Mallee Emu-wren from Vulnerable to Endangered according to IUCN Red List categories and criteria.},

  abstract    = {1. The ability to monitor abundance of animal populations is becoming increasingly important, in light of growing concerns over the loss of biodiversity through anthropogenic changes. A widely used tool for such monitoring is distance sampling, in which distances of detected animals from a line or point are modelled, to estimate detectability and hence abundance. Nevertheless, many species still prove problematic to survey. We have developed two extensions to point transect sampling that potentially allow abundance to be estimated for a number of species from diverse taxa for which good survey methods have not previously been available. 2. For each method, the primary survey comprises a random sample of points, or more usually a systematic grid of points, through the region of interest. Animals are lured to a point, or trapped at a point, and the number of animals observed at each point is recorded. A separate study is conducted on a subset of animals, to record whether they respond to the lure or enter the trap, for a range of known distances from the point. These data are used to estimate the probability that an animal will respond to the lure or enter the trap, as a function of its initial distance from the point. This allows the counts to be converted to an estimate of abundance in the survey region. 3. We illustrated the methods using a lure survey of crossbills Loxia spp. in coniferous woodland in Scotland. 4. Synthesis and applications. Two extensions of point transect sampling that use the same statistical methodology, lure point transects and trapping point transects, have been developed. Lure point transects extend the applicability of distance sampling to species that can be lured to a point, while trapping point transects potentially allow abundance estimation of species that can be trapped, with fewer resources needed than trapping webs and conventional mark-recapture methods. \textcopyright{} 2006 British Ecological Society.},

We studied a breeding songbird community in a landscape characterized by scattered openings in a forest matrix in Vermont, 1993-94. We measured species composition, abundance, and fledgling brood density in the forested areas of 10500-ha sites; we compared a group of 5 disturbed-canopy sites (?10\% canopy disturbance) with a control group of 5 undisturbed-canopy sites. We conducted 456 point counts to determine species composition and abundance, and we conducted 60 line transect surveys to estimate fledgling brood density as a measure of productivity. Adult densities were not different between groups (P \textquestiondown{} 0.05) for 18 species listed as priority for conservation, although power was low. Combined brood densities of all species, Neotropical migrants, and ground nesters were not different among groups (P \textquestiondown{} 0.05). Brood densities of 3 Neotropical migrants also were not different (P \textquestiondown{} 0.05). However, combined brood density of area-sensitive, forest interior species was greater on control sites (P \textexclamdown{} 0.05). At the scale of this study, a minimal amount of canopy removal in the extensively forested landscape did not affect abundance and overall productivity of songbirds inhabiting the remaining forest, but canopy removal had begun to suppress productivity of some forest interior species.},

We introduce the application of a distance-sampling technique for estimating brood density of fledgling birds in forested habitats. During 1993 and 1994, we conducted 60 line-transect surveys on 10 sites in the Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont. Sites were divided into two groups, which allowed us to test for differences in fledgling density between groups. We detected 508 broods representing 38 species. Using standard distance-sampling procedures, we estimated densities of 0.576 (C.V.= 11.89) and 0.513 (C.V.=12.54) broods per hectare. Density was not statistically different between groups. As with other survey methods, distance sampling favors easily detected species; however, line-transect density of fledglings is less obtrusive and less labor-intesive than mist-netting or nest searches, and can contribute important information to studies of avian communities.},

We surveyed 143 stations across 13 transects in Pu`u `O `Umi Natural Area Reserve on Kohala from February through April 2017 and compared our results to data from the 1979 HFBS conducted at 80 stations across three transects in the same location as our study site. We detected 2806 individuals of 15 species and measured relative abundance, relative occurrence, and density for seven species. We observed changes in species densities ranging from -8.4\% (Hawai`i `Elepaio, Chasiempis sandwichensis) to +714\% (`I`iwi, Drepanis coccinea). Equivalence testing showed meaningful increases in population densities for all but one species, the Hawai`i `Elepaio. The increases in population densities on Kohala are in stark contrast to the widespread declines in population densities of native species elsewhere in Hawai`i. Relative occurrence was greater in 2017 than in 1979 for all species except Hawai`i `Elepaios and House Finches (Haemorhous mexicanus), and relative abundance increased for all species except Hawai`i `Elepaios, House Finches, and Melodious Laughing Thrushes (Garrulax canorus). We also documented the range expansion of Japanese Bush Warblers (Cettia diphone) in Kohala. Our results indicate that this spatially isolated avian community remains biologically diverse, and most population densities are increasing in the study area. Our results provide a framework for future surveys and a baseline for understanding possible changes in population and community dynamics as birds respond to climate change and avian disease on Kohala volcano.},

However, incorporating MR data in DS models raises survey and analysis issues not present in conventional DS. Conversely, incorporating DS assumptions in MR models raises issues not present in conventional MR. As a result, being familiar with either conventional DS methods or conventional MR methods does not on its own put practitioners in good a position to apply MRDS methods appropriately. This study explains the sometimes subtly different varieties of MRDS survey methods and the associated concepts underlying MRDS models. This is done as far as possible without giving mathematical details \textendash{} in the hope that this will make the key concepts underlying the methods accessible to a wider audience than if we were to present the concepts via equations. We illustrate use of the two main types of MRDS model by using data collected on two different types of survey: a survey of ungulate faecal pellets where two observers searched independently of each other; and a cetacean survey that used a search protocol that could accommodate responsive movement, with only one observer searching independently and the other being aware of all detections. Synthesis and applications. Mark\textendash recapture DS is a widely used method for estimating animal density and abundance when detection of animals at distance zero is not certain. Two observer configurations and three statistical models are described, and it is important to choose the most appropriate model for the observer configuration and target species in question. By way of making the methods more accessible to practicing ecologists, we describe the key ideas underlying MRDS methods, the sometimes subtle differences between them, and we illustrate these by applying different kinds of MRDS method to surveys of two different target species using different survey configurations.},

We employed autonomous hydrophone receivers to record the soundscapes of healthy, sponge-rich hard-bottom habitat in Florida Bay, Florida (USA) and hard-bottom areas impacted by sponge die-offs. We also recorded sounds emanating from individual sponges of three species that were isolated in underwater sound booths, and then enumerated the invertebrates (mostly snapping shrimp) dwelling within the canals of each sponge. From these recordings, a modified cylindrical sound propagation model was used to estimate distances to individual snapping shrimp snaps. Using the program Distance, we estimated snapping shrimp population density and abundance within both habitat types. More snapping shrimp snaps per unit time were recorded in healthy hard-bottom areas as compared to degraded hard-bottom areas. In addition, the average distance to a snap source was greater within degraded hard-bottom areas than within healthy hard-bottom areas. As a consequence, the estimated density and abundance of snapping shrimp were one to two orders of magnitude greater within healthy habitat than within degraded habitat. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using acoustic sampling and modeling to rapidly assess populations of soniferous benthic indicator species, whose vocalizations may yield indirect estimates of habitat quality.},

  abstract    = {In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral and faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5-6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P. villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment. We detected significant differences between years for four species of birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting robust patterns that transcend particular locations.},

During photo-identification research we obtained 4,212 identifications of 824 humpback whales and 2,403 identifications of 908 blue whales primarily through non-systematic small-boat surveys along the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington. Line-transect surveys from NOAA ships in 1991, 1993, and 1996 covered approximately 39,000 km along the coast of Baja California, California, Oregon, and Washington out to 555 km from shore. The nearshore and clumped distribution of humpback whales allowed photographic identification from small boats to cost-effectively sample a substantial portion of the population, but made it difficult to obtain effective samples in the line-transect surveys covering broad areas. The humpback capture-recapture estimates indicated humpback whale abundance increased over the six years (from 569 to 837). The broader more offshore distribution of blue whales made it harder to obtain a representative sample of identification photographs, but was well suited to the line-transect estimates. The line-transect estimates, after correction for missed animals, indicated approximately 3,000 blue whales (CV = 0.14). Capture-recapture estimates of blue whales were lower than this: approximately 2,000 when using photographs obtained from the line-transect surveys as one of the samples. Comparison of the results from the two methods provides validation, as well as insight into potential biases associated with each method.},

  abstract   = {The extension of distance sampling methods to accommodate observations from camera traps has recently enhanced the potential to remotely monitor multiple species without the need of additional data collection (sign production and decay rates) or individual identification. However, the method requires that the proportion of time is quantifiable when animals can be detected by the cameras. This can be problematic, for instance, when animals spend time above the ground, which is the case for most primates. In this study, we aimed to validate camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) for the semiarboreal western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) in Ta\"i National Park, C\^ote d'Ivoire by estimating abundance of a population of known size and comparing estimates to those from other commonly applied methods. We estimated chimpanzee abundance using CTDS and accounted for limited availability for detection (semiarboreal). We evaluated bias and precision of estimates, as well as costs and efforts required to obtain them, and compared them to those from spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) and line transect nest surveys. Abundance estimates obtained by CTDS and SECR produced a similar negligible bias, but CTDS yielded a larger coefficient of variation (CV = 39.70\% for CTDS vs. 1\%/19\% for SECR). Line transects generated the most biased abundance estimates but yielded a better coefficient of variation (27.40\textendash 27.85\%) than CTDS. Camera trap surveys were twice more costly than line transects because of the initial cost of cameras, while line transects surveys required more than twice as much time in the field. This study demonstrates the potential to obtain unbiased estimates of the abundance of semiarboreal species like chimpanzees by CTDS. HIGHLIGHTS Camera trap distance sampling produced accurate density estimates for semiarboreal chimpanzees. Availability for detection must be accounted for and can be derived from the activity pattern.},

  abstract    = {Line transects have been widely applied for the estimation of animal abundance because they are regarded as simple, economical, and relatively precise. The recent development of automated techniques for the estimation of animal density from distance sampling data allows greater potential for field biologists and wildlife managers to become involved in the analytical summary of their research. An assessment was made of the ability of program DISTANCE to produce unbiased estimates of density in spite of potential sources of error from the estimation of transect and population density. Populations were simulated to investigate the robustness of program DISTANCE to changes in the density, distribution, and detection of animals across sampling areas and transects. It is concluded that if distance sampling data is collected reliably from a random sample of possible primary sampling units (PSUs) it can be expected that estimates of density will be presented accurately and with correct estimates of variance. If the proportion of the study area surveyed by transects is large however, then the presence of large between PSU variation will cause the variance estimates from program DISTANCE to be a sizeable overestimate.},

The abundance and density of the Long-tailed Wood-Partridge was estimated by point counts with playback distance sampling from March-October of 1998-2000 in a temperate coniferous forest managed for timber production by a Mexican indigenous community. The average detection rate was 0.31 individuals per point, resulting in a mean estimate for population density of 20.9 birds/km2 and a mean population estimate of 2679 individuals, estimated using the half-normal key function with cosine adjustments. Density estimates of the Long-tailed Wood-Partridge were 8 individuals/km2 in dry, open, scrubby habitats with deep ash and sand volcanic deposits subject to intense human use and in closed canopy, humid forests with moderate human disturbance. Density estimates were 14.6 and 21.5 individuals/km2 in humid, closed canopy, multi-stratified forests. The latter areas are recommended as the core area for protection of the Long-tailed Wood-Partridge.},

Sequential procedures are constructed for both parametric and nonparametric animal abundance estimators. The criterion used to derive the stopping rules is the width of confidence intervals for the animal abundance. For each estimator considered, we develop stopping rules based on the asymptotic distributions and the bootstrap. A sequential analysis on an aerial survey of the southern bluefin tuna indicates substantial saving of survey effort can be made by employment of the proposed sequential procedures. This savings of survey effort is also observed in a simulation study designed to evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed sequential procedures.},

Managers/researchers sometimes sample unpaved roads assuming that these do not violate important assumptions. However, relatively few studies have attempted to address this, simultaneously comparing behavior between roads and transects, a key issue as behavior can potentially affect detection. Here, we used distance sampling to compare abundance and behavior of agoutis between transects and unpaved roads. We sampled an isolated agouti population during two contrasting seasons. Road densities (347\textendash 432 agoutis/km\textsuperscript{2} for dry and wet seasons, respectively) were statistically similar to those from transects (373\textendash 322 agoutis/km\textsuperscript{2}, respectively). However, road data had a different variance contribution, lower detection probability and poorer model fitting. We also found that agoutis move/interact and forage/feed differently on roads in comparison with transects and were more vigilant in transects than in roads during the first season we sampled (wet). Together, these findings indicated that (1) we detect agoutis differently on these two transect types and (2) road sampling more seriously violates the assumption of randomness of transects in relation to animals. We conclude that while avoiding roads is unfeasible given time and logistical limitations, researchers should be aware of the potential bias, making this clear when discussing and comparing their results.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract   = {Knowing the ecology of game species is important to define sustainable hunting pressure and to plan management actions aimed to maintain viable populations. Common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) is one of the main gamebird species in Europe and North America, despite its native range extending from the Caucasus to Eastern China. This research aimed to define the environmental variables shaping the spatial distribution of male pheasants and to estimate their breeding density in an agroecosystem of northern Italy. During the breeding season, 2015, we carried out 372 point counts with unlimited distances, randomly placed following a stratified sampling survey design. The habitat requirements of the pheasant were evaluated following a presence vs. availability approach, using environmental variables related to land use cover and landscape configuration. We built generalized linear models with a binary distribution, selecting variables following an information-theoretic approach. Densities were estimated through both conventional and multiple-covariate distance sampling. We estimated a density of 1.45 males/km2, with 4.26 males/km2 in suitable areas and 0.91 males/km2 in unsuitable ones. We found pheasants in areas with meadows and tree plantations, which were used to find food and refuges from predators and bad weather conditions. Similarly, woodlands have a positive effect on species occurrence, whereas arable lands were avoided, specifically maize and paddy fields. We found little evidence that landscape configuration affects pheasant occurrence. We found pheasants to be negatively affected by the length of edges between woodlands and arable lands, whereas edges between woodlands and grasslands seem to be beneficial for the species. These findings could help landscape and wildlife managers to plan habitat improvement actions useful to maintain self-sustaining populations of this species, by increasing cover of woodlands, meadows, and tree plantations.},

  abstract    = {We estimated the population density of dogs by distance sampling and assessed the potential utility of two marking methods for capture-mark-recapture applications following a mass canine rabies-vaccination campaign in Sorsogon Province, the Republic of the Philippines. Thirty villages selected to assess vaccine coverage and for dog surveys were visited 1 to 11 days after the vaccinating team. Measurements of the distance of dogs or groups of dogs from transect lines were obtained in 1088 instances (N = 1278 dogs; mean group size = 1.2). Various functions modelling the probability of detection were fitted to a truncated distribution of distances of dogs from transect lines. A hazard rate model provided the best fit and an overall estimate of dog-population density of 468/km2 (95\% confidence interval, 359 to 611). At vaccination, most dogs were marked with either a paint stick or a black plastic collar. Overall, 34.8\% of 2167 and 28.5\% of 2115 dogs could be accurately identified as wearing a collar or showing a paint mark; 49.1\% of the dogs had either mark. Increasing time interval between vaccination-team visit and dog survey and increasing distance from transect line were inversely associated with the probability of observing a paint mark. Probability of observing a collar was positively associated with increasing estimated density of the dog population in a given village and with animals not associated with a house. The data indicate that distance sampling is a relatively simple and adaptable method for estimating dog-population density and is not prone to problems associated with meeting some model assumptions inherent to mark-recapture estimators. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

To better direct conservation actions for this species there was a need to assess habitat requirements on a regional-scale and to estimate the population size using quantitative methods. We used vegetation mapping and the current distribution of the Black-eared Miner to determine regional-scale habitat requirements. These findings were combined with the results of distance sampling to provide population estimates. The species is restricted to large tracts of intact mallee in the Murray Mallee of southeastern Australia that have not been burnt for at least 45 years. The density of Black-eared Miners is highest in areas that are dominated by mallee-Triodia associations and have not been intensively grazed. The Bookmark Biosphere Reserve supports an estimated 501 (270-927, 95\% Cl) colonies, containing 3 758 (2 026-6 954) phenotypically pure Black-eared Miners, 2 255 (1 215-4170) hybrids and small numbers of Yellow-throated Miners Manorina flavigula. However, the effective population size is considerably smaller (390 Black-eared Miners (210-726) and 234 hybrids (126-433)), due to a skewed adult sex ratio (1 female: 1.81 males) and complex social organization. A smaller population also persists in the Murray Sunset National Park containing 53 (32-85) Black-eared Miner/hybrid colonies. Both populations face a high risk of extinction from large-scale wildfire. The endangered status of the species under IUCN criteria remains warranted.},

  abstract    = {Knowledge of animal abundance is fundamental to many ecological studies. Frequently, researchers cannot determine true abundance, and so must estimate it using a method such as mark-recapture or distance sampling. Recent advances in abundance estimation allow one to model heterogeneity with individual covariates or mixture distributions and to derive multimodel abundance estimators that explicitly address uncertainty about which model parameterization best represents truth. Further, it is possible to borrow information on detection probability across several populations when data are sparse. While promising, these methods have not been evaluated using mark-recapture data from populations of known abundance, and thus far have largely been overlooked by ecologists. In this paper, we explored the utility of newly developed mark-recapture methods for estimating the abundance of 12 captive populations of wild house mice (Mus musculus). We found that mark-recapture methods employing individual covariates yielded satisfactory abundance estimates for most populations. In contrast, model sets with heterogeneity formulations consisting solely of mixture distributions did not perform well for several of the populations. We show through simulation that a higher number of trapping occasions would have been necessary to achieve good estimator performance in this case. Finally, we show that simultaneous analysis of data from low abundance populations can yield viable abundance estimates. \textcopyright{} 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Mark-recapture models were used to estimate abundance, which was converted to density using estimates of effective trap area. Tests of model assumptions provided by CAPTURE indicated pronounced heterogeneity in capture probabilities and some indication of behavioral response and variation over time. Mean estimated density was 1.80 mongooses/ha (range, 1.37-2.15/ha) with estimated coefficients of variation of 4.68-11.92\% ({\=X} = 7.46\%). Estimates of density based on mark-recapture data depended heavily on assumptions about animal home ranges; variances of densities also may be underestimated, leading to unrealistically narrow confidence intervals. Estimates based on trap webs require fewer assumptions, and estimated variances may be a more realistic representation of sampling variation. Because trap webs are established easily and provide adequate data for estimation in a few sample occasions, the method should be efficient and reliable for estimating densities of mongooses.},

  abstract    = {Since the heterogeneity of oceanographic conditions drives abundance, distribution, and availability of prey, it is essential to understand how foraging predators interact with their dynamic environment at various spatial and temporal scales. We examined the spatio-temporal relationships between oceanographic features and abundance of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), the largest free-ranging predator in the Western Mediterranean Sea (WM), through two independent approaches. First, spatial modeling was used to estimate whale density, using waiting distance (the distance between detections) for fin whales along ferry routes across the WM, in relation to remotely sensed oceanographic parameters. At a large scale (basin and year), fin whales exhibited fidelity to the northern WM with a summer-aggregated and winter-dispersed pattern. At mesoscale (20-100\^A km), whales were found in colder, saltier (from an on-board system) and dynamic areas defined by steep altimetric and temperature gradients. Second, using an independent fin whale satellite tracking dataset, we showed that tracked whales were effectively preferentially located in favorable habitats, i.e. in areas of high predicted densities as identified by our previous model using oceanographic data contemporaneous to the tracking period. We suggest that the large-scale fidelity corresponds to temporally and spatially predictable habitat of whale favorite prey, the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), while mesoscale relationships are likely to identify areas of high prey concentration and availability.},

In the Austral summers of 1997-98, 1998-99, and 1999-2000 we conducted line-transect surveys of Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) abundance off the north, east, and south coasts of the South Island of New Zealand. Survey methods were modified for the use of a 15-m sailing catamaran, which was equipped with a collapsible sighting platform giving observers an eye-height of 6 m. Eighty-six percent of 2061 km of survey effort was allocated to inshore waters (4 nautical miles [nmi] or 7.4 km from shore), and the remainder to offshore waters (4-10 nmi or 7.4-18.5 km from shore). Transects were placed at 45\textdegree{} to the shore and spaced apart by 1, 2, 4, or 8 nmi according to pre-existing data on dolphin density. Survey effort within strata was uniform. Detection functions for sheltered waters and open coasts were fitted separately for each survey. The effect of attraction of dolphins to the survey vessel and the fraction of dolphins missed on the trackline were assessed with simultaneous boat and helicopter surveys in January 1999. Hector's dolphin abundance in the coastal zone to 4 nmi offshore was calculated at 1880 individuals (CV=15.7\%, log-normal 95\% CI=1384-2554). These surveys are the first line-transect surveys for cetaceans in New Zealand's coastal waters.},

  abstract    = {Abstract Habitat fragmentation in heterogeneous landscapes is a non-random process, with farmers selecting lands with flat topography and fertile soils. To understand the persistence of biodiversity in forest fragments in such landscapes, it is necessary to distinguish between factors associated with fragmentation (e.g., area and distance to edge) and characteristics of where fragments are located (e.g., topography and soil conditions). Location factors have been previously demonstrated to be important in explaining the persistence of trees in fragments in the environmentally diverse region of Xishuangbanna, China (Liu and Slik, Biological Conservation, 2014). However, it is unknown how location factors influence more mobile, short-lived organisms. We sampled 42 of the previous study's plots for birds and herpetofauna across two years. A multi-model inference approach indicated that topography was the most important predictor of amphibian diversity, with valleys having more than three times the species in other locations. Topography interacted with fragment size for bird species, and particularly forest interior (FI) species: diversity in valley plots climbed strongly with fragment area, but the relationship between area and diversity was less strong in other locations. Soil type (limestone or not) most strongly influenced the score of plots on the first axis of a \{NMDS\} ordination of \{FI\} birds. These results suggest that managers should consider the location of fragments in the landscape in prioritizing forest fragments for protection. For Xishuangbanna, all valley fragments are important to protect amphibians; amalgamating them into large fragments \&gt; 1000 ha will make them most useful for bird conservation.},

  abstract    = {Scopoli's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) is a Procellariiform endemic to the Mediterranean Basin which is considered to be vulnerable in Europe due to recent local declines and its susceptibility to both marine and terrestrial threats. In the 1970s\textendash 1980s, its population size was estimated at 57,000\textendash 76,000 breeding pairs throughout the Mediterranean Basin, with the largest colony, estimated at 15,000\textendash 25,000 pairs, found on Zembra Island, Tunisia. The objectives of our study were to re-estimate the size of the breeding population on Zembra Island, to reassess the global population size of the species, and to analyse the implications of these findings on status and conservation of this species in the Mediterranean. Using distance sampling, we estimated the Zembra breeding population to be 141,780 pairs (95\^A \% confidence interval 113,720\textendash 176,750 pairs). A review of the most recent data on populations of this species throughout the Mediterranean Basin led us to estimate its new global population size at 141,000\textendash 223,000 breeding pairs. Using the demographic invariant and potential biological removal approaches, we estimated the maximum number of adults which could be killed annually by all non-natural causes without causing a population decline to be 8800 (range 7700\textendash 9700) individuals, of which could be 3700 breeders. Although these results are less alarming in the context of species conservation than previously thought, uncertainties associated with global population size, trends and major threats still raise questions on the future of this species. More generally, we show how a monitoring strategy for a bird supposed to be relatively well known overall can be potentially misleading due to biases in survey design. The reduction of such biases would therefore appear to be an unavoidable prerequisite in cryptic species monitoring before any reliable inference on the conservation status of the species can be drawn.},

The Bo\'e sector contains a substantial bauxite deposit in a region called Ronde Hill, and there are plans for the construction of a mine, which may endanger the chimpanzee population. In 1-week survey in May 2013, we used the standing crop nest counts method to obtain the number of chimpanzee nests and from that estimate the density and abundance of chimpanzees. We carried out five 1-km line transects that covered the bauxite deposit and surrounding valleys. We used density surface modeling to analyze habitat preferences, then predicted chimpanzee nest density and distribution based on environmental variables. We found the projected location of the mine partially coincides with an area of high predicted abundances of chimpanzee nests and is surrounded by highly suitable areas for chimpanzees (northeast and southwest). We conclude the mine could have significant direct and indirect effects on this population of chimpanzees whose impacts must be carefully considered and properly mitigated if the mine is built.},

  abstract    = {The whiptail lizard \emph{Cnemidophorus vanzoi} is a large-bodied teiid found only on two islands (Maria Major and Maria Minor), off St Lucia, West Indies. In May 1995, 42 lizards from Maria Major were introduced to the smaller uninhabited Praslin Island on the same coastline. Three years post-release, we studied abundance, demography and morphometrics of the translocated lizard population, during a 6-month period covering wet and dry seasons. Age, sex, snout-vent length (SVL), body mass (BM), tail length, tail regeneration, and overall condition (moulting, reproductive condition, cuts, external parasites) of 107 animals caught during the study are analysed in the present paper. Comparisons are also made with the source population. A body condition index (CI (BM/SVL)), sex ratio (adult males: adult females), age ratio (adults: juveniles), and sexual size dimorphism ratio (SVL adult male: SVL adult females) were calculated for the study population. Distance sampling and mark-re-sight surveys were used to estimate population size and lizard density. A total of 155 {$\pm$} 26 individuals were estimated. The lizard population was found to have a high growth rate (r = 0.97-3.95). There were significant seasonal changes in lizard abundance. Seasonal differences in lizard numbers, BM and CI suggest either severe resource limitation during the dry season, or selective aestivation. A high frequency of tail autotomy may point to intense intraspecific competition as the island is relatively free from main predators such as the black rat Rattus rattus. Sex ratio, sexual size dimorphism and sexual dichromatism all indicate a territorial species in a generally non-territorial family (Teiidae). Some adult males seem to maintain juvenile colours. It is suggested that the introduced population has successfully colonized its new environment and that no significant change in the animals condition or size has occurred during the 3 years since translocation.},

  abstract    = {Differences among observers in ability to detect and identify birds has been long recognized as a potential source of error when surveying terrestrial birds. However, few published studies address that issue in their methods or study design. We used distance sampling with line transects to investigate differences in detection probabilities among observers and among three species of grassland songbirds: Henslow's Sparrow \emph{(Ammodramus henslowii)}, Grasshopper Sparrow \emph{(A. savannarum)}, and Savannah Sparrow \emph{(Passerculus sandwichensis)}. Our review of 75 papers published in 1985-2001 found that the most commonly used methods were fixed-width transects (31\%, 23 papers) and fixed-radius point counts (20\%, 15 papers). The median half-width of fixed-width strip transects used by researchers was 50 m, but our results indicated detection probabilities were \textexclamdown 1.0 at distances \textquestiondown 25 m for most observers and species. Beyond 50 m from the transect line, we found that as many as 60\% of birds were missed by observers and that the proportion missed differed among observers and species. Detection probabilities among observers ranged from 0.43 to 1.00 for Henslow's Sparrow, from 0.44 to 0.66 for Grasshopper Sparrow, and from 0.60 to 0.72 for Grasshopper Sparrow for birds detected within 58-100 m of the transect line. Using our estimates of detection probabilities for Henslow's Sparrows among six observers in a computer simulation of a monitoring program, we found that bird counts from fixed-width transects required an additional 2-3 years of monitoring to detect a given decline in abundance compared to density estimates that used a method to correct for missed birds. We recommend that researchers employ survey methods that correct for detection probabilities \textexclamdown 1.0.},

In July 2001, a pilot survey was conducted to compare the use of line transects with strip transects for estimating koala abundance. Both methods provided a similar estimate of density. On the basis of the results of the pilot survey, the distribution and abundance of koalas in the Pine Rivers Shire, south-east Queensland, was determined using line-transect sampling. In total, 134 lines (length 64 km) were used to sample bushland areas. Eighty-two independent koalas were sighted. Analysis of the frequency distribution of sighting distances using the software program DISTANCE enabled a global detection function to be estimated for survey sites in bushland areas across the Shire. Abundance in urban parts of the Shire was estimated from densities obtained from total counts at eight urban sites that ranged from 26 to 51 ha in size. Koala abundance in the Pine Rivers Shire was estimated at 4584 (95\% confidence interval, 4040-5247). Line-transect sampling is a useful method for estimating koala abundance provided experienced koala observers arc used when conducting surveys.},

  abstract    = {\textexclamdown p\textquestiondown Track-while-scan bird radars are widely used in ornithological studies, but often the precise detection capabilities of these systems are unknown. Quantification of radar performance is essential to avoid observational biases, which requires practical methods for validating a radar\^a\texteuro\texttrademark s detection capability in specific field settings. In this study a method to quantify the detection capability of a bird radar is presented, as well a demonstration of this method in a case study. By time-referencing line-transect surveys, visually identified birds were automatically linked to individual tracks using their transect crossing time. Detection probabilities were determined as the fraction of the total set of visual observations that could be linked to radar tracks. To avoid ambiguities in assigning radar tracks to visual observations, the observer\^a\texteuro\texttrademark s accuracy in determining a bird\^a\texteuro\texttrademark s transect crossing time was taken into account. The accuracy was determined by examining the effect of a time lag applied to the visual observations on the number of matches found with radar tracks. Effects of flight altitude, distance, surface substrate and species size on the detection probability by the radar were quantified in a marine intertidal study area. Detection probability varied strongly with all these factors, as well as species-specific flight behaviour. The effective detection range for single birds flying at low altitude for an X-band marine radar based system was estimated at \^a\textasciicircum{$\frac{1}{4}$}1.5 km. Within this range the fraction of individual flying birds that were detected by the radar was 0.50\^A{$\pm$}0.06 with a detection bias towards higher flight altitudes, larger birds and high tide situations. Besides radar validation, which we consider essential when quantification of bird numbers is important, our method of linking radar tracks to ground-truthed field observations can facilitate species-specific studies using surveillance radars. The methodology may prove equally useful for optimising tracking algorithms.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown},

The objective of this study was to determine the applicability of the line transect method to estimate population densities of three francolin species, Swainson's spurfowl, crested and Natal francolin. Surveys were conducted in Sporobolus ioclados-Acacia tortilis Savanna in the Nylsvley Nature Reserve. Relative species composition showed 75.7\% Swainson's spurfowl, 16.9\% crested and 7.4\% Natal francolin. Early morning counts within two hours of sunrise, when temperatures are low and with no wind or cloud cover, revealed the best results. Detectability was estimated as 85.6\%. The Uniform Simple polynomial model was selected based on the lowest Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) values. Population density of all three species combined was estimated as 6.76 francolin/ha with an encounter rate of 32.24 francolin/km. A coefficient of variation of 23.57\% and a poor model fit (AIC 1650.28; GOF {$\chi^2$} P = 0.024) indicated that the line transect method may not be a suitable method to count francolin in this plant community. However, this method may be improved to some extent by including additional lines to increase replication, stratifying the study area into low- and high-density units, and including the adjacent Nyl floodplain into the survey. This study suggests a need to improve the line transect method and to investigate other counting techniques to assist in monitoring these species.},

Data are collected along 36 systematically-arranged transects. We provide the first thorough assessment of the data from any survey within this long-term project. The transect data from 2011 were analysed with DISTANCE software to assess if the data were suitable for determining the densities of large mammals using distance sampling techniques. Successful application of distance sampling depended on observers using printed, large-scale, georeferenced satellite images onto which they mapped the location of animal groups detected. The assumptions of the distance sampling were well met and thus the 2011 survey provided reliable estimates of the densities of nine species of common large mammals on the Zambezi alluvium during the late dry season. Estimated density in this dry-season concentration area varied from 3.6 km-2 for kudu, to 204 km-2 for impala. The precision of the estimates ranged from a coefficient of variation of 7.9\% for elephant, to 25.5\% for buffalo. For elephant, warthog and baboon, the morning and afternoon densities differed significantly.},

  abstract    = {Line-transect analysis is a widely used method of estimating plant and animal density and abundance. A Bayesian approach to a basic line-transect analysis is developed for a half-normal detection function. We extend the model of Karunamuni and Quinn [Karunamuni, R.J., Quinn II, T.J., 1995. Bayesian estimation of animal abundance for line-transect sampling. Biometrics 51, 1325-1337] by including a binomial likelihood function for the number of objects detected. The method computes a joint posterior distribution on the effective strip width and the density of objects in the sampled area. Analytical and computational methods for binned and unbinned perpendicular distance data are provided. Existing information about effective strip width and density can be brought into the analysis via prior distributions. The Bayesian approach is compared to a standard line-transect analysis using both real and simulated data. Results of the Bayesian and non-Bayesian analyses are similar when there are no prior data on effective strip width or density, but the Bayesian approach performs better when such data are available from previous or related studies. Practical methods for including prior data on effective strip width and density are suggested. A numerical example shows how the Bayesian approach can provide valid estimates when the sample size is too small for the standard approach to work reliably.

  abstract   = {Bushmeat is a major source of protein and income in tropical regions but is often over-harvested. A better monitoring of bushmeat stocks could help achieve sustainability. We used a combination of simulations and transect survey data collected from blue duikers (Philantomba monticola) in the Lomako wildlife reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo, to investigate the use of transect-based distance sampling to monitor bushmeat stocks. The comparison of dung piles and direct observations of duikers evidenced that animals avoided both the transects in the absence of observers, and the observers themselves. This type of behavioural response appeared common in a literature survey. It causes a negative bias in the estimates of population densities from the standard distance sampling methodology. This negative bias would lead to over-pessimistic predictions of population viability, especially if the behavioural response is more intense in the locations where the animals are hunted. In turn, this would lead to excessively conservative management recommendations. To correct for the effect of the behavioural response of the animals to either the transects or the observers, we recommend recording both the forward and perpendicular distances to the observers (2D distance sampling), not just the perpendicular distance. We also recommend multiple-observer protocols. As a cautionary note, we also demonstrate a scenario where the intensity of the behavioural response is too high to reliably estimate the abundance of the population. As a perspective, we outline the general principles of a local stakeholder-based program combining distance sampling with less intensive types of ecological indicators to monitor wildlife populations.},

Kudu occupy thick vegetation and helicopter-based counts are not appropriate. In this study we tested line transect counts of faecal pellets in conjunction with DISTANCE analysis as a method for assessing the abundance of kudu. Transects were undertaken in three regions of two game reserves and the results compared with helicopter based game counts (for two regions) and a known kudu population in the third region (an enclosed breeding centre). Estimates of kudu abundance were two to three times greater than the helicopter counts, but within the known number of kudu in the breeding centre. The increased accuracy in the breeding centre was probably because the transects covered a greater percentage of the available habitat (0.07\%) than in the reserves (approximately 0.007\%). We suggest that DISTANCE software and line transects counts of pellet groups can be used for kudu and probably for other ungulates in thicket-type vegetations. Accuracy will depend on the percentage of the available habitat that is surveyed and on the accuracy of the defecation and decay rates.},

Variable area transect (VAT) sampling had been identified, and optimized relative to effort, in previous Monte Carlo simulated population studies as a low-labor field method that demonstrated superior estimation properties among many PDEs considered. However, natural populations tend to be much more complex and less predictable in spatial distribution than computer generated populations. Therefore, we carried out a Monte Carlo simulation study that used 17 fully enumerated field populations rather than simulated populations. These natural populations represented a variety of population densities and spatial patterns. We focused on assessing the effect of the number of population members searched for along each transect (r), sample size, and transect width on estimation quality. Using relative root mean-squared error and relative bias as criteria, the optimal range for r was 5 to 7 population members encountered from each start point. Sample size was best if n \textquestiondown{} 20, but returns in estimation quality diminished by n = 40. Transect width was previously uninvestigated and found to be the most important design factor affecting estimation quality. Field studies should strive for transects as wide as logistically reasonable.},

  abstract  = {Line transect distance sampling is a popular method for estimating the density of animals across the tropics. The method relies on accurate measurements of the distance between an animal and a transect to model detectability. In dense tropical forests, surveys can become time-consuming, expensive, and dangerous when randomly placed straight line transects cross landscape features such as rivers, swamps, and dense vegetation. As a result, transects often curve as an observer deviates from an ideal, straight line. Here, we examine the practical and statistical impact of these curves. We use distance sampling simulations to assess bias in density estimates based on scenarios corresponding with different methods reliant on distinct field measurements. Methods that measure the nearest distance between the animal and the curving transect produce the most reliable density estimates. Biased estimates were obtained when using methods that ignore curves, measure the distance to an ideal line (as opposed to the curve), or inaccurately calculate the area covered in the survey. Notably, these biased estimates were most severe when observation distances were short, highlighting the importance of accurate measurements in tropical forests characterized by low visibility. Given these results and the importance of reliable density estimates to conservation efforts across the tropics, we propose a method that addresses survey design, simplifies data collection, and alleviates some of the practical field challenges associated with straight line transects. We also developed an R package (CurveTransect) based on this method with functions that ensure accurate measurements and reliable density estimates in tropical forests.},

We compared northern bobwhite covey densities on 1,088 paired row-crop fields with and without native herbaceous buffers in 13 states during autumn, 2006\^a\texteuro ``2008. We used a 2-stage random effects modeling approach that incorporates the effective area as an offset in generalized linear mixed models to assess regional relationships among autumn bobwhite covey densities and covariates of field type (i.e., fields with vs. without native herbaceous buffers), ecological region, year, survey week, and contracted vegetative cover (i.e., planting native grasses and forbs vs. establishing through natural regeneration). Covey density was correlated with year and interaction effects of field type and ecological region. The year effect suggested annual variation in covey densities, whereas the field type by ecological region interaction suggested covey response to buffers was dependent on spatial location, likely reflecting differences in buffer establishment, succession, and characteristics of the surrounding landscape among regions. Mean fitted covey density on fields across all survey sites was 0.047 (\^A{$\pm$}0.008 bootstrap standard error [BSE]) and 0.031\^a\texteuro\textperthousand coveys/ha (\^A{$\pm$}0.003 BSE) on row-crop fields with and without herbaceous buffers, respectively. Covey density was greater on fields with buffers relative to matched, comparison fields without buffers in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (241\%; P\^a\texteuro\textperthousand\textexclamdown\^a\texteuro\textperthousand 0.001) and both the eastern (123\%; P\^a\texteuro\textperthousand\textexclamdown\^a\texteuro\textperthousand 0.001) and western (60\%; P\^a\texteuro\textperthousand =\^a\texteuro\textperthousand 0.01) portions of the Southeastern Coastal Plain region. Covey density was an order of magnitude greater in the central Texas region compared to other regions, but exhibited a small response to native herbaceous buffers, as did density of coveys in the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie and Central Hardwoods regions. Disproportionate response to buffers in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley and Southeastern Coastal Plain suggests native herbaceous habitats might be limiting during autumn in these regions, whereas lack of response in the Eastern Tallgrass Prairie, Central Hardwoods, and central Texas regions suggests that herbaceous habitat either was not limiting or buffers failed to provide adequate requirements for bobwhites during autumn. Selection of other habitats to meet security and thermoregulatory needs might have resulted in lack of response in these regions. Native herbaceous cover provided by buffers can provide critical habitat in row-crop agricultural systems in some regions, and can contribute to regional population recovery objectives of the Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative (NBCI). However, range-wide NBCI recovery objectives will best be met through multiple conservation practices in row-crop agricultural systems. \^A\textcopyright{} 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract    = {\textexclamdown p\textquestiondown Sperm whales are present in the Canary Islands year-round, suggesting that the archipelago is an important area for this species in the North Atlantic. However, the area experiences one of the highest reported rates of sperm whale ship-strike in the world. Here we investigate if the number of sperm whales found in the archipelago can sustain the current rate of ship-strike mortality. The results of this study may also have implications for offshore areas where concentrations of sperm whales may coincide with high densities of ship traffic, but where ship-strikes may be undocumented. The absolute abundance of sperm whales in an area of 52933 km\textexclamdown sup\textquestiondown 2\textexclamdown/sup\textquestiondown, covering the territorial waters of the Canary Islands, was estimated from 2668 km of acoustic line-transect survey using Distance sampling analysis. Data on sperm whale diving and acoustic behaviour, obtained from bio-logging, were used to calculate g(0) = 0.92, this is less than one because of occasional extended periods when whales do not echolocate. This resulted in an absolute abundance estimate of 224 sperm whales (95\% log-normal CI 120?418) within the survey area. The recruitment capability of this number of whales, some 2.5 whales per year, is likely to be exceeded by the current ship-strike mortality rate. Furthermore, we found areas of higher whale density within the archipelago, many coincident with those previously described, suggesting that these are important habitats for females and immature animals inhabiting the archipelago. Some of these areas are crossed by active shipping lanes increasing the risk of ship-strikes. Given the philopatry in female sperm whales, replacement of impacted whales might be limited. Therefore, the application of mitigation measures to reduce the ship-strike mortality rate seems essential for the conservation of sperm whales in the Canary Islands.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown},

  abstract  = {Estimating the density and distribution of invasive populations is critical for management and control efforts but can be a challenge in nascent infestations when population densities are low. Statistically-valid sampling designs that account for imperfect detection of individuals are needed to estimate densities across time and space. Survey methods that yield reliable estimates allow managers to determine how invader biomass affects ecosystem services and evaluate population trends and effectiveness of control measures. We investigated the use of distance sampling via self-contained underwater breathing apparatus divers to determine densities of invasive Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in 2 recently-invaded lakes in central Minnesota. This framework allows divers to cover the large areas necessary in low-density, recent infestations. We estimated that a diver could detect between 5 and 41\% of the mussels present in the surveyed area, depending on the specific diver and on whether the lake bottom was vegetated. Presence of vegetation had a greater influence on detection probability than diver identity. We also found our sampling design did not meet a key assumption of conventional distance sampling: that detection along the transect line is perfect. Therefore, accurate density estimates required a double-observer approach. These results highlight the importance of accounting for detectability when comparing estimates over time or across lakes, particularly when different observers conduct surveys. However, further evaluation is needed to determine if changes in field sampling techniques can meet the assumptions behind conventional distance sampling for freshwater mussels. We also suggest that the efficiency of distance sampling should be compared to alternatives such as quadrat sampling across a range of mussel densities.},

Whilst me methodology of measuring spatial autocorrelation is well developed, there is no established infrastructure for statistical inference in terms of correlation analysis or ANOVA. We survey the literature that deals with these problems, as well as some of the approaches that have been proposed for taking autocorrelation into account in inferential statistics. We apply these approaches to a data set comprising Antarctic pack ice seal counts as well as a few environmental measures. In contrast to the predictions from the existing literature, nonlinear estimation suggested that Pearson's r substantially overestimates the tree correlation between seal densities and environmental variables. When compared to spatially adjusted analysis of variance, conventional ANOVA that compared seal densities or pack ice characteristics in different areas overestimated the degree of difference between these areas in proportion to the degree of spatial autocorrelation of the particular data set. In our case, the effects of spatial autocorrelation were not neutralised by treating entire transects as single points. These results emphasise the need for a methodology that takes spatial autocorrelation into account for interpreting the spatial data on Antarctic seals collected during the Antarctic pack ice seal (APIS) program. New software written for performing these analyses is available from the senior author.},

  abstract    = {Spotlighting (SL) is used widely to estimate animal abundance, but it yields density estimates that are underestimated and biased. Introduction of distance sampling has, to a large extent, contributed to solving these problems, but the reliability of this statistical method depends strongly on sample size. Thermal infrared (TI) imaging may improve number of observations, but very few studies have quantified performance of TI imaging relative to SL. This comparison is relevant because the high cost of a TI device is justified only by a significant increase of observations and a consequent reduction of labor costs. Our objectives were to compare animal detectability by SL and TI imaging as a function of animal size, species (red deer \emph{[Cervus elaphus]}, fallow deer \emph{[Dama dama]}, wild boar \emph{[Sus scrofa]}, red fox \emph{[Vulpes vulpes]}, European rabbit \emph{[Oryctolagus cuniculus]}, and brown hare \emph{[Lepus europaeus]}), distance, and season. We also analyzed group size and composition for red deer and effect of grass height on detection of hares and rabbits. On average, TI imaging was more efficient (P\textexclamdown 0.001) than SL, which detected only 53.8\% of the animals observed by TI imaging. This was especially true for wild boar (92.1\%), but both devices observed comparable red fox (P=0.60) and fallow deer (P=0.72) numbers. Relative detectability of the 2 devices was influenced by different factors: for red deer, TI was more efficient than SL in summer and autumn, but not in winter; male groups of red deer were better observed by TI imaging than by SL; and wild boars were better imaged at short (0-100-m) distances with TI. Relative effectiveness of both instruments was not influenced by grass height (P=0.92). Our results showed that wild boar should only be surveyed using TI imager and that a strong improvement of sample size can be obtained using TI for red deer, brown hare, and European rabbit.},

  abstract    = {We used distance sampling (line transects) and mark-resight to estimate habitat and local area (area size, range: 3.9-44.5 ha) population density of ungulates. The distance sampling study was performed on fallow deer \emph{(Dama dama)}, roe deer \emph{(Capreolus capreolus)} and wild boar \emph{(Sus scrofa)} in a mediterranean forest. The mark-resight study was performed on a roe deer population in a hilly area of the Apennines. The first study allowed us to estimate the animal density into four different habitats (deciduous oak wood, evergreen oak wood, maquis and open areas with domestic-pine woods). The between habitat differences of population density are large for the three species: fallow deer are more abundant in the open areas (22.22 heads/km2, c.i. 12.42-39.74), roe deer in the deciduous oak wood (14.50 heads/km2, c.i. 7.01-30.10) and wild boar in both the open areas (11.29 heads/km2, c.i. 4.86-26.20) and evergreen oak wood (10.42 heads/km2, c.i. 6.78-16.02). The roe deer population in the Apennines is characterized by large between-zone variations of population density (range: 1997: 13.25-131.31, 1998: 29.06-78.01, 1999: 10.67-88.58). Moreover, trends of local zones may be quite different with respect to the average trend of a wider study area, suggesting a well-defined short-scale spatial structure for this population. We conclude that both survey methods may be very useful in population assessment, but they need intense field effort and careful statistical design. Care needs to be taken to satisfy the assumptions of the statistical models. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Three different surveys (1 per year from 1995 to 1997) were analyzed. Density estimates, pooled among years, for fallow deer (9.9 deer/km{$^2$}, \%CV = 24) and roe deer (8.5 deer/km{$^2$}, \%CV = 21) were more precise than the estimate for wild boars (10.6 boars/km{$^2$}, \%CV = 55). Fallow deer density was significantly higher during 1997 than during 1995 or 1996. For wild boars, we found differences among years (1995: 23.6 boars/km{$^2$}, \%CV = 23; 1996: 10.9 boars/km{$^2$}, \%CV = 24; 1997: 3.9 boars/km{$^2$}, \%CV = 33). We attempted a confirmatory analysis using an independent survey method for fallow deer and total counts at supplementary feeding sites for wild boars. These comparisons showed that line transect estimates were negatively biased for fallow deer during 1996-1997 and for wild boars during 1997. For adults, the composition by sex from line transects was compared with information collected from fixed observation points. Differences in sex composition for fallow deer and wild boars were found when these 2 methods were compared. The structure of the roe deer population was similar when line transect information was compared with independent survey data. A spike in the detection probability function for wild boars may have been caused by the difficulty of detecting boars \textquestiondown 20 m from the transect. The careful use of line transect sampling may prove useful for both research and management of fallow deer, roe deer, and wild boars.},

  abstract    = {Monitoring rare species of wild ungulates is critical for their conservation management. The Italian roe deer \emph{Capreolus capreolus italicus} was recently confirmed to be a subspecies in Mediterranean habitats of central and southern Italy. We have monitored this subspecies at Castelporziano, near Rome, since 1988, and detected an abrupt population decline in 2001. We compared distance sampling surveys undertaken before and after the population crash to determine the ability of this method to detect variations in animal density and to investigate which factors may influence the precision of the estimates. We used radio tagged roe deer to evaluate the accuracy of our surveys, comparing distance sampling and mark-resight estimates at the same site, and studying the behavioural reaction of the animals to the presence of an observer. We found that before the crash distance sampling surveys attained a good precision but that the survey conditions influenced both precision and accuracy. Post-crash surveys were less precise, but the difference in density, before and after the crash was highly significant, indicating the potential of the method to quickly detect density variations and so to allow wildlife managers to react without delay to a crisis. The direct test of distance sampling assumptions showed that estimates were almost unbiased. We conclude that the methodology was successful for monitoring this population and that it may be used in other situations where ungulates are rare and efficient monitoring must be attained with restricted budgets. \textcopyright{} 2005 FFI.},

  abstract    = {The evaluation of anuran call-count survey methods against more precise population estimation techniques for validation purposes is being researched only recently. Many investigators believe that call-survey methods should be calibrated to true population size to obtain reliable records, and this has not been done for call-survey methods in Neotropical regions. We compared anuran survey methodologies in the Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico. We evaluated using mark-recapture, transects, and point counts to survey Eleutherodactylus populations for information content, logistics, and effort in native cordillera forest and eucalyptus plantations. We used programs CAPTURE and DISTANCE to generate population estimates and associated variances. Mark-recapture results showed density of E. coqui males was greater (P=0.04) in native forest. Total population estimates derived from mark-recapture were used with calling estimates to calculate proportion of calling males. Humidity was associated with density of calling males in native forest (P\textexclamdown 0.001) and eucalyptus (P=0.01) plantations. Call counts of E. coqui within 5-m radius of points were correlated with density of calling males in native (P\textexclamdown 0.001) and eucalyptus (P=0.001) sites and for combined data (P\textexclamdown 0.001). We recommend that mark-recapture be used when detailed information is needed on an anuran species. Mean species richness detected between line transect (x=1.98) and point count (x=1.67) differed significantly; only one frog species was detected using mark-recapture. Point counts required the least effort but provided the least amount of useful information. Future research should develop predictive models linking call counts to density estimates and examine seasonal effects.},

  abstract    = {Many North American grassland bird populations appear to be declining, which may be due to changes in grazing regimes on their breeding areas. Establishment of water developments and confining cattle (Bos taurus L.) to small pastures often minimizes spatial heterogeneity of cattle forage consumption, which may lead to uniformity in vegetative structure. This increased uniformity may provide suitable habitat for some bird species but not others. We assessed how cattle use, vegetative structure, and bird population densities varied with increasing distance from water developments (0-800 m) on the Little Missouri National Grassland (LMNG) in North Dakota. Lark buntings (Calamospiza melancorys Stejneger), which are typically associated with low vegetative cover, decreased with increasing distance from water developments. Horned larks (Eremophila alpestris L.), also a low-cover associate, followed a similar but weaker trend. Densities of another low-cover associate as well as moderate- and high-cover associates were not related to distance from water. Vegetative height-density and litter depth increased by 50 and 112\%, respectively, while cowpie cover and structural variability decreased by 51 and 24\%, respectively, with distance from water. Confidence interval overlap was common among all measures, showing substantial variability among study sites. Our results indicate cattle use is higher closer to water developments, and this pattern may positively affect the densities of lark buntings and horned larks. The absence of density gradients in the other bird species may be due to the paucity of locations \textquestiondown{} 800 m from water on the LMNG.},

In light of climate change and the effects of fire exclusion, single and repeated high-severity (stand-replacement) fires have become prominent land management issues. We studied bird communities using point counting in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of Oregon, USA at various points in time after one or two high-severity fires. Time points included 2 and 3 years after a single fire, 17 and 18 years after a single fire, 2 and 3 years after a repeat fire (15 year interval between fires), and \textquestiondown 100 years since stand-replacement fire (mature/old-growth forest). Avian species richness did not differ significantly among habitats. Bird density was highest 17 and 18 years after fire, lowest 2 years after fire, and intermediate in repeat burns and unburned forest. Bird community composition varied significantly with habitat type (A\^A =\^A 0.24, P\^A \textexclamdown\^A 0.0001) with two distinct gradients in species composition relating to tree structure (live to dead) and shrub stature. Using indicator species analysis, repeat burns were characterized by shrub-nesting and ground-foraging bird species while unburned mature forests were characterized by conifer-nesting and foliage-gleaning species. Bird density was not related to snag basal area but was positively related to shrub height. Contrary to expectations, repeated high-severity fire did not reduce species richness, and bird densities were greater in repeat burns than in once-burned habitats. Broad-leaved hardwoods and shrubs appear to play a major role in structuring avian communities in the Klamath-Siskiyou region. In light of these results, extended periods of early seral broadleaf dominance and short-interval high-severity fires may be important to the conservation of avian biodiversity.},

Mound densities were estimated using belt transects and distance sampling, the grasslands were burned, and the estimated mound densities compared to complete ant mound counts made on each of the five sites. Mound population density estimates did not differ among the three methods. Detection of S. invicta mounds decreased with distance from the line transect on three sites. Based on the detection function derived by Program DISTANCE for these sites, we recorded 89.9, 97.3, and 98.1\% of S. invicta mounds within 1 m and 70.8, 89.9, and 92.7\% of S. invicta mounds within 2 m of the line transects, respectively. The 2-m belt transects and distance sampling are accurate estimators of S. invicta mound densities in grassland habitats. Although distance sampling is more time consuming, it does not require the assumption that all mounds are observed. This benefit was not obvious in this study because of the similarity of our sites and the high detectability of mounds within the 2-m belt transects. Accuracy of belt transects would decrease if wider transects were used or if detectability of S. invicta mounds was lower, such as in denser vegetation. We recommend using belt transects or distance sampling to estimate S. invicta mound density in grassland habitats.},

  abstract    = {Line-transect estimators were developed to assess abundance of coastal dolphins Tursiops truncatus and Stenella coeruleoalba encountered in low densities during aerial sighting surveys. The analysis improved on conventional approaches by objectively combining data from different species, survey areas and other covariates affecting dolphin detectability. Model selection and multimodel inference allowed robust estimates of precision in accounting for covariate selection uncertainty. These methods were used to estimate bottlenose dolphin abundance in NE Mediterranean waters that included a putative subpopulation in the Balearic Islands. Total abundance was estimated as 7654 (coefficient of variation, CV = 0.47; 95 \% CI = 1608 to 15 766) and the abundance in inshore waters of the Balearic Islands varied from 727 (CV = 0.47; 95 \% CI = 149 to 1481) dolphins in spring 2002 to 1333 (CV = 0.44; 95 \% CI = 419 to 2617) dolphins in autumn 2002, with an average estimate of 1030 (CV = 0.35; 95 \% CI = 415 to 1849). The results do not support an exclusively coastal Balearic Island subpopulation, but they strongly indicate that the islands contain critical habitats required for the conservation of the species. Given the observed decline of the species during the last few decades, conservation-oriented management should focus on reducing or eliminating adverse fishing interactions while key areas are protected from encroachment produced by human development.},

  abstract = {Fisheries bycatch mortality poses a primary threat to the majority of the world's 22 albatross species, 15 of which are at risk of extinction. Although quantitative estimates of albatross bycatch are often unavailable due to a relative or total absence of monitoring, spatial overlap between fisheries and albatrosses is often used to estimate the extent of interaction, a proxy for exposure to bycatch, and to inform avoidance and mitigation actions. Using comprehensive records of commercial demersal longline and trap fishing and survey information for albatrosses (black-footed albatross Phoebastria nigripes, Laysan albatross P. immutabilis, short-tailed albatross P. albatrus), the extent of spatial potential interaction was estimated in Canada's Pacific coast waters and examined across breeding and non-breeding seasons. The distributions of albatrosses and longline and trap fisheries were found to substantially overlap, with potential interaction hotspots concentrated along the continental shelf break. Trap fisheries reported 1 albatross bycatch incident, suggesting that these fisheries are responsible for negligible albatross mortalities. In contrast, {$>$}80\% of recorded albatross bycatch incidents occurred within 10 km of albatross-longline fisheries hotspot locations, providing evidence that longline-albatross potential interaction hotspots represent actual areas of elevated bycatch mortality risk. Indicative of potential conservation concern, 60\% of short-tailed albatross sightings occurred within 10 km, and 93\% within 30 km, of longline-albatross potential interaction hotspots. By contributing knowledge regarding albatross-fisheries interactions, in addition to undertaking the first evaluation of albatross-fisheries hotspots with recorded bycatch incidents on Canada's Pacific coast, this study represents a step towards enhancing albatross conservation through bycatch avoidance and mitigation.},

  abstract    = {The desert tortoise \emph{(Gopherus agassizii)} was listed as a U.S. threatened species in 1990 based largely on population declines inferred from mark-recapture surveys of 2.59-km2 (1-mi2) plots. Since then, several census methods have been proposed and tested, but all methods still pose logistical or statistical difficulties. We conducted computer simulations using actual tortoise location data from 2 1-mi2 plot surveys in southern California, USA, to identify strengths and weaknesses of current sampling strategies. We considered tortoise population estimates based on these plots as ``truth" and then tested various sampling methods based on sampling smaller plots or transect lines passing through the mile squares. Data were analyzed using Schnabel's mark-recapture estimate and program CAPTURE. Experimental subsampling with replacement of the 1-mi2 data using 1-km2 and 0.25-km2 plot boundaries produced data sets of smaller plot sizes, which we compared to estimates from the 1-mi 2 plots. We also tested distance sampling by saturating a 1-mi 2 site with computer simulated transect lines, once again evaluating bias in density estimates. Subsampling estimates from 1-km2 plots did not differ significantly from the estimates derived at 1-mi2. The 0.25-km2 subsamples significantly overestimated population sizes, chiefly because too few recaptures were made. Distance sampling simulations were biased 80\% of the time and had high coefficient of variation to density ratios. Furthermore, a prospective power analysis suggested limited ability to detect population declines as high as 50\%. We concluded that poor performance and bias of both sampling procedures was driven by insufficient sample size, suggesting that all efforts must be directed to increasing numbers found in order to produce reliable results. Our results suggest that present methods may not be capable of accurately estimating desert tortoise populations.},

  abstract    = {Like many Neotropical frogs, a number in the genus \emph{Eleutherodactylus} have declined or gone extinct in the past two decades. However, the extent of Eleutherodactylus population declines is unknown. Our objective was to identify a good method for monitoring the density of Eleutherodactylus populations to assess the extent of declines. We did this in two ways. First, we compared two methods of directly estimating density, closed population capture-recapture analysis and distance sampling, and one method of indirectly estimating density, visual encounter surveys, for multiple \emph{Eleutherodactylus} species at three sites in Ecuador. We then conducted a power analysis to estimate the power of our current sampling design to detect declines. Distance sampling estimates of density were biased low compared to capture-recapture estimates. When we corrected this bias, distance sampling estimates became imprecise. Estimates of density from visual encounter surveys were also imprecise. In contrast, capture-recapture estimates were fairly precise and most likely unbiased. Moreover, capture-recapture analysis had the most power to detect declines, although even with capture-recapture analysis, power was low with only five years of sampling. We conclude that capture-recapture analysis is a good method for monitoring \emph{Eleutherodactylus} density over time, but the sampling area and/or the number of sampling occasions should be increased from the area and number of occasions used here in order to increase sample sizes and therefore power.},

  abstract    = {Hornbills are useful indicators of forest condition and human disturbance because they require large tracts of unfragmented forest with large fruiting trees for feeding and nesting. They are relatively large-bodied, which makes them targets for hunting. Density estimates of such species are critical for population monitoring and serve as a baseline against which future changes can be measured. In this study we used variable-width line transect surveys to estimate the densities of nine hornbill species in the Bala portion of the Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary on the Thai-Malaysia border, one of the few remaining areas of lowland forest in Thailand. The hornbill species were: Rhinoceros \emph{(Buceros rhinoceros)}, Great \emph{(B. bicornis)}, Helmeted \emph{(B. vigil)}, Black \emph{(Anthracoceros malayanus)}, Bushy-crested \emph{(Anorrhinus galeritus)}, White-crowned \emph{(Aceros comatus)}, Wrinkled \emph{(A. corrugatus)}, Wreathed \emph{(A. undulatus)} and Plain-pouched \emph{(A. subruficollis)}. Between January 2001 and April 2002, 11 transects along trails, old logging roads and one paved road were surveyed once per month. A total of 1,261 observations of the nine species were made during the observation period. Estimates for Rhinoceros and Helmeted Hornbill were 2.69 and 1.21 individuals/ km2, respectively, and were similar or slightly higher than densities reported elsewhere. Estimates for Great (0.12), Bushy-crested (0.64), Wrinkled (0.08), White-crowned (0.08) and Wreathed Hornbills (0.69) were generally lower than estimates from other areas in the region. It was not possible to obtain density estimates using distance sampling for Black and Plain-pouched Hornbills due to the small number of observations, but our data did suggest that their densities were also low (\textquestiondown 0.10 individuals/km2). Potential reasons for differences between this and other areas include a scarcity of lowland habitat, habitat isolation, lower abundance of specific fruit resources and interspecific competition, but these factors require further investigation. Standardization of survey techniques among studies would significantly improve assessments of habitat requirements as well as of the effects of human disturbance on Asian hornbills, most of which are globally threatened. Our study specifically underscores the need for additional research on the Plain-pouched Hornbill, the most threatened of the species studied, as density estimates from elsewhere in its range are lacking, while more generally it highlights the need to investigate the underlying causes of the often substantial variation in hornbill densities among species and sites. \textcopyright{} BirdLife International 2006.},

  abstract    = {Significant changes in the climates of Central America are expected over the next century. Lowland rainforests harbor high alpha diversity on local scales (\textexclamdown 1\^A km2), yet montane landscapes often support higher beta diversity on 10-100\^A km2 scales. Climate change will likely disrupt the altitudinal zonation of montane communities that produces such landscape diversity. Projections of biotic response to climate change have often used broad-scale modelling of geographical ranges, but understanding likely impacts on population viability is also necessary for anticipating local and global extinctions. We model species' abundances and estimate range shifts for birds in the Tilar\~A\textexclamdown n Mountains of Costa Rica, asking whether projected changes in temperature and rainfall could be sufficient to imperil high-elevation endemics and whether these variables will likely impact communities similarly. We find that nearly half of 77 forest bird species can be expected to decline in the next century. Almost half of species projected to decline are endemic to Central America, and seven of eight species projected to become locally extinct are endemic to the highlands of Costa Rica and Panam\~A\textexclamdown. Logistic-regression modelling of distributions and similarity in projections produced by temperature and rainfall models suggest that changes in both variables will be important. Although these projections are probably conservative because they do not explicitly incorporate biological or climate variable interactions, they provide a starting point for incorporating more realistic biological complexity into community-change models. Prudent conservation planning for tropical mountains should focus on regions with room for altitudinal reorganization of communities comprised of ecological specialists.},

Abundance and trends of these dolphin stocks were assessed from 12 large-scale pelagic surveys carried out between 1979 and 2000. Estimates of abundance were based on a multivariate line-transect analysis, using covariates to model the detection process and group size. Current estimates of abundance are about 640 000 northeastern offshore spotted dolphins (CV = 0.17) and 450 000 eastern spinner dolphins (CV = 0.23). For the whole period from 1979 to 2000, annual estimates of abundance ranged from 494 000 to 954 000 for northeastern offshore spotted dolphins and from 271 000 to 734 000 for eastern spinner dolphins. Management actions by USA and international fishing agencies over 3 decades have successfully reduced dolphin bycatch by 2 orders of magnitude, yet neither stock is showing clear signs of recovery. Possible reasons include underreporting of dolphin bycatch, effects of chase and encirclement on dolphin survival and reproduction, long-term changes in the ecosystem, and effects of other species on spotted and spinner dolphin population dynamics. \textcopyright{} Inter-Research 2005.},

  abstract    = {1. The reliability of deer population management could be improved with good density estimates, but current methods are either labour-intensive or suffer from uncertainties regarding accuracy. 2. Visibility varies substantially in forests depending on stand type, age and understorey vegetation. In such conditions distance sampling would be an efficient estimation method, but observer disturbance often results in bias when the method is applied to deer. 3. The performance of thermal imaging for estimating deer density by distance sampling was assessed in seven forest deer populations. Thermal imaging equipment can detect the long-wave energy radiated by natural objects, clearly revealing warm-bodied animals even if partly obscured by vegetation. 4. Many more deer were detected at night using a thermal imager than along the same transect routes in daytime. Detection distances were correlated with visibility but were substantially longer than the average distances at which most animals were disturbed. Most deer were detected without causing prior disturbance. 5. Densities were estimated with a coefficient of variation ranging from 10.2-28.4\%. Precision depended on sampling effort and sample sizes obtained. 6. A Monte Carlo simulation revealed a quadratic relationship between accuracy and visibility, with accuracy increasing with average visibility and a tendency for deer to select more open habitats within a forest. Under conditions that are likely to be typical of temperate forests (\textexclamdown{} 40\% thicket and neutral selection, or \textexclamdown{} 70\% thicket if thicket is avoided), accuracy was generally good and changed relatively little in relation to visibility and habitat selection. 7. Likely sources of bias as well as alternatives to thermal imaging are discussed. It is concluded that the method would be suitable for estimating ungulate densities in forests with an adequate network of tracks.},

The bird community was species poor, supporting approximately 20 species. Richness and diversity were low compared with other British scrub habitats. The two dominant species were Willow Warbler (52\% of territory mapping registra-tions) and Chaffinch (18\% of registrations). Densities derived from territory mapping and transect counts (Distance sampling) were similar. Willow Warbler densities were high and comparable with preferred habitats in lowland England and Fennoscandia. Contour mapping, correlation and canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that successional stage, represented by birch cover, was the single most important factor determining community composition and individual species' distributions. Meadow Pipits persisted at low densities in sparse birch; Tree Pipits occurred through-out the range of birch densities. Willow Warblers preferred areas of medium height birch at intermediate canopy cover. Wren, Great Tit and Long-tailed Tit occurred in older birch scrub. The relatively simple bird-habitat relationships reported are con-trasted with more complex patterns elsewhere. These findings are discussed in the context of scrub and woodland regeneration in upland Britain with particular reference to mosaics and maintenance of avian diversity.},

  abstract    = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Current methods for estimating feral pigeon (Columba livia f. domestica) population size and for monitoring population trends are mainly based on indices, which according to the current literature on wildlife census methods often produce biased results. Distance Sampling techniques have never been used in this context, even though they could theoretically produce absolute abundance estimates at relatively low costs. The aim of this paper was to investigate the performance of Distance Sampling to census feral pigeons, and to compare these results with those obtained by using Quadrate Counts, a widespread method for monitoring these birds. Surveys were performed in Pisa (Italy) in two different periods of the year 2004 (end of January\^a\texteuro ``beginning of February, and November), which correspond to minimum (January\^a\texteuro ``February) and maximum (November) numbers for pigeon populations. We considered 40 line transects each about 250\&nbsp;m long for Distance Sampling, and 40 250\^a\texteuro\textperthousand\"i\textquestiondown{$\frac{1}{2}$}\^a\texteuro\textperthousand 250\&nbsp;m cells for Quadrate Counts. In both cases, sampling units were randomized in a stratified design. In contrast to Quadrate Counts, Distance Sampling detected the predicted increase of abundance from January\^a\texteuro ``February to November with an acceptable precision and no increase of costs per survey. Even though the possible biases (due to the not rigorously random distribution of transects and to the spiked nature of collected distance data) should be further investigated, results suggest that Distance Sampling is a viable and efficient alternative to the traditional methods used to estimate feral pigeons population size and to monitor trends.},

  abstract   = {Distance sampling is a popular statistical method to estimate the density of wild animal populations. Conventional distance sampling represents animals as fixed points in space that are detected with an unknown probability that depends on the distance between the observer and the animal. Animal movement can cause substantial bias in density estimation. Methods to correct for responsive animal movement exist, but none account for nonresponsive movement independent of the observer. Here, an explicit animal movement model is incorporated into distance sampling, combining distance sampling survey data with animal telemetry data. Detection probability depends on the entire unobserved path the animal travels. The intractable integration over all possible animal paths is approximated by a hidden Markov model. A simulation study shows the method to be negligibly biased ({$<$}5\%) in scenarios where conventional distance sampling overestimates abundance by up to 100\%. The method is applied to line transect surveys (1999\textendash 2006) of spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) in the eastern tropical Pacific where abundance is shown to be positively biased by 21\% on average, which can have substantial impact on the population dynamics estimated from these abundance estimates and on the choice of statistical methodology applied to future surveys.

  abstract  = {Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) are an icon of conservation success, yet their status is inferred from total counts that cannot account for detection bias and double counts. With an effort of 4,797 km in 725 km2 of western Gir Protected Area, India, we used polygon search based spatially explicit capture recapture framework to estimate lion density. Using vibrissae patterns and permanent body marks we identified 67 lions from 368 lion sightings. We conducted distance sampling on 35 transects with an effort of 101.5 km to estimate spatial prey density using generalized additive modeling (GAM). Subsequently, we modeled lion spatial density with prey, habitat characteristics, anthropogenic factors and distance to baiting sites. Lion density ({$>$}1-year-old lions) was estimated at 8.53 (SE 1.05) /100 km2 with lionesses having smaller movement parameter ({$\sigma$} = 2.55 km; SE 0.12) compared to males ({$\sigma$} = 5.32 km; SE 0.33). Detection corrected sex ratio (female:male lions) was 1.14 (SE 0.02). Chital (Axis axis) was the most abundant ungulate with a density of 63.29 (SE 10.14) as determined by conventional distance sampling (CDS) and 58.17 (SE 22.17)/km2 with density surface modeling (DSM), followed by sambar (Rusa unicolor) at 3.84 (SE 1.07) and 4.73 (SE 1.48)/km2 estimated by CDS and DSM respectively. Spatial lion density was best explained by proximity to baiting sites and flat valley habitat but not as much by prey density. We demonstrate a scientifically robust approach to estimate lion abundance, that due to its spatial context, can be useful for management of habitat and human-lion interface. We recommend this method for lion population assessment across their range. High lion densities in western Gir were correlated with baiting. The management practice of attracting lions for tourism can perturb natural lion densities, disrupt behavior, lion social dynamics and have detrimental effects on local prey densities.},

  abstract    = {Biodiversity on farmland is declining due to agricultural intensification and occurs across many taxa such as plants, insects or birds. Here, we modelled population sizes of five farmland birds in central Germany as the German Sustainability Indicator for Species Diversity (SISD) is based on this taxon. We explored options for sustainable farmland management by generating land-use scenarios at the regional scale. For individual bird species, high SISD scores could be reached by changing environmental variables, such as landscape or crop diversity, percent cover of spring cereals or hedge density. However, contrasting species responses to these variables prevented from reaching high scores for all species simultaneously. We were able to improve the total SISD score from 0.77 at present to 0.94 by increasing landscape and crop diversity or to 0.87 by increasing hedge density and reducing spring cereals, respectively. An economic evaluation of the return losses associated with these changes revealed that annual costs of approx. 5.5\^A [euro]/ha farmland would suffice for this latter increase by optimizing hedges and spring cereals towards high SISD. We conclude that balancing three levels of trade-offs, i.e. contrasting requirements of species, diverging responses in different landscapes, and alternative economic options, is difficult to achieve without systematic modelling. Yet, by accounting for differences in landscape structure and species distributions at a regional spatial scale and by focusing on clearly defined measures such as hedge density or the cover of spring cereals rather than composite indices like landscape or crop diversity it seems possible to develop realisable, affordable and sustainable management strategies.},

Management actions implemented in this area for the recovery of the right whale population rely on accurate habitat characterization and the ability to predict whale distribution over time. We developed a temporally dynamic habitat model to predict wintering right whale distribution in the SEUS using a generalized additive model framework and aerial survey data from 2003/2004 through 2012/2013. We built upon previous habitat models for right whales in the SEUS and include data from new aerial surveys that extend the spatial coverage of the analysis, particularly in the northern portion of this wintering ground. We summarized whale sightings, survey effort corrected for probability of whale detection, and environmental data at a semimonthly resolution. Consistent with previous studies, sea surface temperature (SST), water depth, and survey year were significant predictors of right whale relative abundance. Additionally, distance to shore, distance to the 22\^A\textdegree C SST isotherm, and an interaction between time of year and latitude (to account for the latitudinal migration of whales) were also selected in the analysis presented here. Predictions from the model revealed that the location of preferred habitat differs within and between years in correspondence with variation in environmental conditions. Although cow-calf pairs were rarely sighted in the company of other whales, there was minimal evidence that the preferred habitat of cow-calf pairs was different than that of whale groups without calves at the scale of this study. The results of this updated habitat model can be used to inform management decisions for a migratory species in a dynamic oceanic environment.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown},

  abstract    = {Validating and improving field-sampling techniques for estimating wildlife community composition and population size is essential for wildlife management and conservation. We conducted ground distance sampling surveys along line transects and block counts from a small aircraft in Manyara Ranch in Northern Tanzania and contrasted estimates of species richness and species-specific densities from both sampling techniques. We used regression analyses (logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models) and model selection to investigate whether a species' body size, group size, body color, as well as vegetation cover explained the variation in species presence/absence and relative density differences in aerial vs. ground-based sampling. Ground surveys detected significantly more species than aerial surveys. However, aerial surveys detected three species that were missed by ground surveys (African lions, African buffalo, and spotted hyena). Model selection suggested that species with smaller body mass and small group sizes were more likely to be missed in aerial surveys. Densities estimated from the aerial surveys were generally but non-significantly lower than the densities estimated from the ground surveys, with the exception of density estimates for African elephants which were slightly higher from aerial surveys. Density differences between the two methods were greater for species with small group size, light body color, and in areas with denser vegetation cover; these variables explained 75\% of the variation in density differences between the two survey methods. Albeit being similar in operational costs in our relatively small study area, ground surveys yielded (1) more complete information with respect to wildlife community composition and (2) density estimates were mostly higher and (3) more precise and (4) appear more feasible to be implemented in community-based conservation schemes.},

  abstract    = {1. Large-scale habitat use of eight species of breeding birds was considered using data collected across Britain. The species were skylark \emph{Alauda arvensis (L.)}, dunnock \emph{Prunella modularis (L.)}, blackbird \emph{Turdus merula (L.)}, song thrush \emph{Turdus philomelos (L.)}, starling \emph{Sturnus vulgaris (L.)}, linnet \emph{Carduelis cannabina (L.)}, bullfinch \emph{Pyrrhula pyrrhula (L.)} and reed bunting \emph{Emberiza schoeniclus (L.)}. All are linked by roughly synchronous population declines over the last 25 years in southern Britain (and mostly in farmland landscapes). Discussion is limited to the conservation status of these species. 2. Breeding densities were estimated for broad habitat types and these were used to estimate population sizes within habitat types. Confidence limits on the estimates were derived using a bootstrap procedure. 3. For most species considered, farmland holds a high proportion of their population (in excess of 50\% for four species), reflecting the predominance of this land use across Britain. This suggests that sympathetic changes in farming practices are likely to provide the best mechanism for improving the status of these species. 4. Substantial proportions of particular species occur outside farmland, but different species occur in different habitats. A considerable proportion of skylarks occur on upland moor, bullfinches in wooded habitats, and reed buntings in riparian habitats. Conservation of this group of species thus requires appropriate management of the wider countryside, including their main habitats. 5. Habitats associated with human habitation hold \textquestiondown{} 20\% of the British populations of blackbird, song thrush and starling, and considerable numbers of other species. The management of parks, gardens and other 'green space' may have an important impact on their populations and should not be neglected by conservationists.},

Most of the 33 593 ha island is covered by mature and secondary Atlantic rainforest. Almost 80\% of these forests are within the Ilhabela Park. Although the species counted have marked differences in size and weight, density (individuals/km2) and estimated population size in 23 500 ha of well-preserved forests were similar: \emph{Amazona farinosa} (13.82 {$\pm$} 5.94; 3247 {$\pm$} 1395), \emph{Pionus maximiliani} (15.79 {$\pm$} 7.04; 3712 {$\pm$} 1654), \emph{Brotogeris tirica} (15.05 {$\pm$} 4.87; 3537 {$\pm$} 1143) and \emph{Pyrrhura frontalis} (13.06 {$\pm$} 5.53; 3068 {$\pm$} 1298). Encounter rates of Forpus crassirostris and Pionopsitta pileata were very low, which suggests that there is only a small population of these species on the island. The Sao Sebastiao forests still support healthy populations of parrots. Although woodpecker population estimates on the island are large enough to provide nesting sites for parrots, competition for holes with other secondary cavity nesters such as toucans, flycatchers and tytiras, and the selective cutting of dead trees for canoe construction, which is a common practice on the island, may limit hole availability for parrots.},

  abstract    = {The species-confidence hypothesis asserts that birds prefer mates whose colors match those of their species and avoid potential mates whose colors are atypical of conspecifics. Earlier point-count research indicated this mate-choice hypothesis also may explain avian reactions to observer clothing color. In central Texas, during January and February 1993, we tested further whether the species-confidence hypothesis holds for reactions to observer clothing color by determining how close an investigator could get to individuals before they flushed (approach distance) and how long individuals remained visible near their initial flush point (detectability period). The same investigator experimentally wore or did not wear a hunter-orange vest, which some wildlife biologists wear as a safety precaution during hunting-season field studies. The vest did not affect approach distance for species with red or orange on their bodies (American robin \emph{[Turdus migratorius]}, P = 0.247; northern cardinal \emph{[Cardinalis cardinalis]}, P = 0.196: ruby-crowned kinglet \emph{[Regulus calendula]}, P = 0.434; red-bellied woodpecker \emph{[Melanerpes carolinus]}, P = 0.113). In contrast, approach distances for species without red or orange were longer when the vest was worn than when it was not worn (Carolina chickadee \emph{[Parus carolinensis]}, P = 0.032; northern mockingbird \emph{[Mimus polyglottos]}, P = 0.033; yellow-rumped warbler \emph{[Dendroica coronata]}, P = 0.001). Differences in detectability period between vest conditions depended on air temperature for American robins (P = 0.003) and on the variation in visibility within habitats for northern cardinals (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001). Detectability period was shorter when the vest was worn than when it was not worn for Carolina chickadees (P = 0.057) and yellow-rumped warblers (P = 0.060). Thus, for several species this matechoice hypothesis seems to apply to garment color as well. Some species' reactions demonstrated that, if birds respond significantly to clothing color, important assumptions of distance-sampling techniques used to estimate avian richness, density, and abundance will be violated, and these parameters will be underestimated. Wildlife scientists will be more likely to draw valid inferences and recommend effective management practices from avian data gathered via distance-sampling methods if reactions to clothing color are precluded.},

  abstract    = {1. The status of small cetaceans in the North Sea and adjacent waters has been of concern for many years. Shipboard and aerial line transect surveys were conducted to provide accurate and precise estimates of abundance as a basis for conservation strategy in European waters. 2. The survey, known as SCANS (Small Cetacean Abundance in the North Sea), was conducted in summer 1994 and designed to generate precise and unbiased abundance estimates. Thus the intensity of survey was high, and data collection and analysis methods allowed for the probability of detection of animals on the transect line being less than unity and, for shipboard surveys, also allowed for animal movement in response to the survey platform. 3. Shipboard transects covered 20 000 km in an area of 890 000 km{$^2$}. Aerial transects covered 7000 km in an area of 150 000 km{$^2$}. 4. Three species dominated the data. Harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena were encountered throughout the survey area except in the Channel and the southern North Sea. Whitebeaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris and minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata were found mainly in the north-western North Sea. 5. Phocoena phocoena abundance for the entire survey area was estimated as 341 366 [coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.14; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 260 000-449 000]. The estimated number of B. acutorostrata was 8445 (CV = 0.24; 95\% CI 5000-13 500). The estimate for L. albirostris based on confirmed sightings of this species was 7856 (CV = 0.30; 95\% CI = 4000-13 000). When Atlantic whitesided dolphin Lagenorhynchus acutus and Lagenorhynchus spp. sightings were included, this estimate increased to 11 760 (CV = 0.26; 95\% CI 5900-18 500). 6. Shortbeaked common dolphin Delphinus delphis were found almost exclusively in the Celtic Sea. Abundance was estimated as 75 450 (CV = 0.67; 95\% CI = 23 000-149 000). 7. Current assessments and recommendations by international fora concerning the impact on P. phocoena of bycatch in gillnet fisheries in the North Sea and adjacent waters are based on these estimates.},

  abstract    = {Numerous researchers have documented the adverse effects of feral donkeys Equus asinus introduced to semi-arid ecosystems. With the release of feral donkeys and potential increasing populations in natural habitats in northern Cyprus, there is concern for negative impacts on vegetation and native species. In the north of the island, there has been only one published study of feral donkey populations, and population estimators were relatively subjective. We estimated feral donkey populations on the Karpaz Peninsula using line transect surveys and quantitative distance sampling estimators. We stratified the sampling by using 11 sample units within the study area. We evaluated potential biases associated with habitat, topography, and perpendicular distance from the transect line and found that these variables did not bias donkey detections during our surveys. Using program DISTANCE, we found that a hazard rate cosine model was the best model that described our distance data based on model selection criterion (Akaike's Information Criteria adjusted for small sample bias). Estimated effective strip width was 280.19 m and detection probability was 0.47 with this model. Estimated donkey density was 6.7 donkeys/km 2, and estimated total abundance was 800 donkeys for the entire 132.5 km2 study area. Of 95 donkey groups detected: 16\% were detected in agricultural habitats with flat topography, 9\% were detected in agricultural habitats with sloped topography, 24\% were detected in shrub/forest habitats with flat topography, and 51\% were detected in shrub/forest habitats with sloped topography. Of 102 behavioral observations recorded (multiple behaviors were detected in groups), frequencies of behaviors were 1\% bedded, 70\% standing, 22\% grazing, 6\% moving, and 2\% other. Our estimated donkey population density in the Karpaz Peninsula was \textquestiondown 2 times densities reported in arid regions of the United States and Australia, but slightly lower than earlier density estimates reported for the Karpaz region. These estimates of feral donkey populations in the Karpaz Peninsula provide a quantitative baseline from which to make population management decisions. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

  abstract  = {Ecological restoration has emerged as a key strategy for conserving tropical forests and habitat specialists, and monitoring faunal recovery using indicator taxa like birds can help assess restoration success. Few studies have examined, however, whether active restoration (AR) achieves better recovery of bird communities than natural regeneration, or how bird recovery relates to habitat affiliations of species in the community. In rainforests restored over the past two decades in a fragmented landscape (Western Ghats, India), we examined whether bird species richness and community composition recovery in 23 actively restored (AR) sites were significantly better than recovery in paired naturally regenerating (NR) sites, relative to 23 undisturbed benchmark (BM) rainforests. We measured eight habitat variables and tested whether bird recovery tracked habitat recovery, whether rainforest and open-country birds showed contrasting patterns, and assessed species-level responses to restoration. We recorded 92 bird species in 460 point-count surveys. Rainforest bird species richness was highest in BM, intermediate in AR and lowest in NR. Contrastingly, open-country bird species richness was least in BM, intermediate in AR and highest in NR. Bird community composition varied significantly across treatment types with composition in AR in transition from NR to BM. Bird community dissimilarity between sites was positively related to dissimilarity in habitat structure and floristics, and geographical distance between sites. Variance partitioning indicated that structural and floristic dissimilarity explained 90\% of the variation in community composition. Indicator species analysis revealed significant associations of 34 species with one or more treatment types. Species associated with BM and AR treatment types were all rainforest species, while only 38\% of species associated with AR and NR treatment types were rainforest species. Synthesis and applications. We show that active restoration (AR) of degraded fragments benefits rainforest birds and reduces the infiltration of open-country birds, and highlight the importance of considering rainforest and open-country species separately. In human-modified tropical rainforest landscapes, AR of degraded fragments fosters partial recovery and complements protection of mature forests for bird conservation.},

Traditional sampling approaches, like aerial sampling or mark-capture-recapture, can generate bias by failing to meet sampling assumptions, or by incurring too much cost and logistical burden for most projects to address them. Therefore, we met the IUCN's challenge by testing a sampling technique that leverages imagery from camera traps with conventional distance sampling, validating its operability in mountainous topography by comparing results to known abundances. Our project occurred within a captive facility housing a wild population of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in the Chihuahuan desert of New Mexico, which is censused yearly. True abundance was always within our 90\% confidence bounds, and the mean abundance estimates were within 4.9 individuals (average) of the census values. By demonstrating the veracity of this straightforward and inexpensive sampling method, we provide confidence in its operability, urging its use to fill conservation voids for Caprinae and other data-deficient species inhabiting rugged or heavily vegetated terrain.},

  abstract     = {Results from previous surveys suggest that an area of the northeast Atlantic, the Faroe Shetland Channel, is important for cetaceans. This study utilised passive acoustic survey techniques to evaluate the density of sperm whales in the Channel. Two-week surveys were carried out during oceanographic cruises in May and October 2001, and May 2002. A two hydrophone array was towed behind the vessel throughout the majority of the survey routes and was monitored by a two-person team and by software designed to automatically detect and measure bearings to whales. Distances of individual sperm whales from the trackline were determined using target motion analysis. Standard line transect techniques were applied to calculate the density of whales during surveys. The effects of sea conditions and survey vessel on the ability to detect whales were tested; the encounter rate and effective stripwidth (esw) were estimated independently for each sea state and for each of the vessels. A total of 79 individual whales were detected, and their distances from the trackline were calculated. As a probable result of insufficient sample size and a small effects size, neither the esw nor the encounter rates varied significantly with sea state or between the two survey vessels. The density of sperm whales during each of the surveys was estimated to be 2.05, 0.52 and 1.75 whales per 1,000km2 for the May 2001, October 2001 and May 2002 surveys respectively. Sperm whales were distributed across the majority of the Faroe Shetland Channel. This study has provided the basis for meaningful hypothesis generation in future studies and to gain a better understanding of the factors underlying the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of sperm whales in this area; data on oceanographic, biological and anthropogenic determinants should now be examined.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge has been increasingly recognized as important habitat for both breeding and migratory shorebirds. North American snowy plovers Charadrius nivosus in particular rely on the nearly 5,000-ha salt flat at Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge, which thousands use as breeding and stopover habitat. Elsewhere on the Southern Great Plains, decadal declines up to 75\% within snowy plover subpopulations have been documented and attributed to vegetation encroachment, increased rates of nest predation, and decreased availability of fresh surface water. Despite many attempts to estimate this species' abundance across the continent, to date, no known attempt at distance sampling of snowy plovers has occurred. To address this paucity of data, we assessed feasibility of distance sampling methods to accurately estimate snowy plover abundance and detectability. Distance sampling surveys (2017\textendash 2018) indicated high detection probability (P = 0.80) and the population abundance estimate across the salt flat extrapolated to 3,307 individuals. The distance-sampling population abundance estimate is lower than population abundance estimates determined by two previous studies within the past decade but far greater than 2,105 estimated for a study in 2006. Overall, distance sampling snowy plovers at Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge proved to be an effective addition to pre-established survey protocols but further investigation is needed to compare accuracy and precision of methods used in this study, annual surveys conducted by Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge, and other potential snowy plover surveys.},

GPS-derived home ranges of 32 cats and resource selection indices demonstrated the degree of penetration and preference for native vegetation fragments. Owners reported on prey brought back by 144 domestic cats in Dunedin, New Zealand, during 12\^A months. One third of cats never brought back prey, and 21\% returned more than one item/month. Cats brought back a mean of 13.4 prey items/year (median\^A =\^A 4), with cats aged \textexclamdown 1\^A year returning more prey than older cats. Birds were the most common prey, followed by rodents. Although cats penetrated adjacent vegetation fragments they did not catch more birds and preferred garden habitat, suggesting that predation pressure may be reduced in fragments. Cat home range size appears to be constrained by cat density while the number of birds caught depends on the density of available prey. Estimates of city-wide catch for six bird species were either more than total urban population size estimates or close to lower confidence intervals. Modelling of three species indicated low likelihood of population persistence with cat predation. The observed persistence of these prey species suggests a meta-population structure with urban populations acting as sinks with source populations located on the city fringe.},

These surveys were designed to permit comparisons with similar surveys in 1981, 1982, and 1991. Differences in methods between the surveys in the early 1980s and those in the 1990s should mean that the 1990s surveys were, if anything, more efficient than the 1980s surveys. Weighted linear regressions of strip-census estimates of the relative abundance of belugas showed a significant decline from 1981 to 1994. While annual variability in ice conditions and other unknown factors may have had some local or small-scale effects on the movements and distribution of belugas off West Greenland, it is unlikely that these effects would account for the apparent decline in relative abundance. The most reasonable conclusion is that the stock size has declined considerably during the past 13 years, perhaps by as much as 62\%.\textexclamdown/P\textquestiondown},

To assess potential interaction between porpoises and fisheries in the German Bight, high-resolution spatial and temporal data were analysed in order to reveal association patterns between cetaceans and fisheries in the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea. To facilitate interpretation of resulting patterns, additionally, relationships of fish assemblages were analysed. Vessel monitoring system (VMS) data from 2006 and fisheries surveillance data from 2002 to 2006 were acquired to calculate fishing effort, aerial survey data from 2002 to 2006 to evaluate porpoise distribution, and trawl survey data from 2000 to 2007 to assess fish assemblage. Relationships were analysed in terms of seasonal association and overlap. Results showed that porpoise distribution was positively associated with sandeel fisheries in all seasons and with gillnet fisheries in summer. Overlaps for sandeel and gillnet fisheries were high in summer, while negligible in spring and autumn. In spring, high overlap was found for large beam trawlers targeting sole and plaice. In parallel, porpoise distribution was positively linked to fish assemblage components representing sandeel and poor cod in summer and flatfish in spring. Our results suggest that, especially in summer, resource competition between porpoises and industrial sandeel fisheries is likely and the risk of by-catch in gillnets is increased. In spring, interference with sole and plaice fisheries is to be expected.},

  abstract  = {Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) of the Southern Hemisphere were brought to near extinction by twentieth century industrial whaling. For decades, they had all but disappeared from previously highly frequented feeding grounds in Antarctic waters. Our dedicated surveys now confirm their return to ancestral feeding grounds, gathering at the Antarctic Peninsula in large aggregations to feed. We report on the results of an abundance survey and present the first scientific documentation of large fin whale feeding aggregations at Elephant Island, Antarctica, including the first ever video documentation. We interpret high densities, re-establishment of historical behaviours and the return to ancestral feeding grounds as signs for a recovering population. Recovery of a large whale population has the potential to augment primary productivity at their feeding grounds through the effects of nutrient recycling, known as 'the whale pump'. The recovery of fin whales in that area could thus restore ecosystem functions crucial for atmospheric carbon regulation in the world's most important ocean region for the uptake of anthropogenic CO2.},

  abstract    = {Spotlight transect surveys with distance sampling were used to estimate spring (pre-breeding) and autumn (post-production) fox \emph{Vulpes vulpes} densities in three contrasting rural areas of Britain during 1995-97. This was the first attempt in Britain to measure and compare fox densities over large geographical areas (630-1460 km2). Mean post-production fox abundance was estimated to be 0.90/km2, 2.62/km2, and 0.59/km2 in mid-Wales, the east Midlands and East Anglia, falling to pre-breeding levels of 0.41/km2, 1.17/km2, and 0.16/km2 in spring. As relative measures of regional density, these estimates are strongly supported by independent indices of fox abundance, and by the simultaneous survey of two sympatric species, the badger Meles meles and brown hare Lepus europaeus, which demonstrate the absence of any terrain-related bias. Absolute abundance is less easy to verify, but estimates of spring density based on breeding earth censuses support the transect surveys. For two of the three regions, fox density was close to levels predicted by extrapolation on the basis of landscape, but in the third region (East Anglia), fox density was substantially below prediction. Thus, results failed to support a hypothesis that fox abundance can be predicted solely on the basis of landscape and its close correlates. Rather, they favoured a competing hypothesis that an independent factor determines fox abundance in some regions. A likely factor is culling by man.},

We argue that existing paths or game trails may be suitable as transects for line transect sampling even though they will not, in general, run straight. Formulas and software currently used to estimate local density using perpendicular distance data can be used with closest approach distances measured from curving transects. Suitable paths or trails are those for which the minimum radius of curvature is rarely less than the width of the shoulder in the detection probability function. The use of existing paths carries the risk of bias resulting from unrepresentative sampling of available habitats, and this must be weighed against the increase in coverage available.},

  abstract    = {Effective conservation of coastal marine mammals is largely dependent on reliable knowledge of their abundance, as well as the ecological and human factors driving their distribution. In developing countries, lack of resources and capacity frequently impedes research needed to estimate abundance and to determine the ecological requirements of coastal marine mammals and the impact of threats related to coastal development and fisheries. Over the course of 5 years, we developed practical research methods and trained local scientists in Thailand to use accepted line transect distance sampling methods for abundance assessment. The study focused on a little-known coastal and freshwater species found throughout Southeast Asia, namely the Irrawaddy dolphin, which has been sighted regularly along the coast of the eastern Gulf of Thailand. During 5 years of line transect boat surveys in Trat Province, the eastern-most province in Thailand, we found an average of 423 dolphins distributed within 12 km of the coast. Compared to other abundance estimates of coastal Irrawaddy dolphins in Southeast Asia, this is a relatively large number. This population could extend into the northern coast of Cambodia, where surveys are currently being planned. The Thai government has begun talks with Cambodia about a transboundary marine protected area that would include areas in both countries where coastal Irrawaddy dolphins are found. Collaboration between scientists in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam is further needed to determine dolphin movement and habitat use across borders.},

  abstract  = {Monitoring large herbivores across their core range has been readily accomplished using aerial surveys and traditional distance sampling. But for peripheral populations, where individuals may occur in patchy, low-density populations, precise estimation of population size and trend remains logistically and statistically challenging. For moose (Alces alces) along their southern range margin in northern New York, USA, we sought robust estimates of moose distribution, abundance, and population trend (2016\textendash 2019) using a combination of aerial surveys (line transect distance-sampling), repeated surveys in areas where moose were known to occur to boost the number of detections, and density surface modeling (DSM) with spatial covariates. We achieved a precise estimate of density (95\% CI = 0.00\textendash 0.29 moose/km2) for this small population (656 moose, 95\% CI = 501\textendash 859), which was patchily distributed across a large and heavily forested region (the 24,280-km2 Adirondack Park). Local moose abundance was positively related to active timber management, elevation, and snow cover, and negatively related to large bodies of water. As expected, moose abundance in this peripheral population was low relative to its core range in other northern forest states. Yet, in areas where abundance was greatest, moose densities in New York approached those where epizootics of winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) have been reported, underscoring the need for effective and efficient monitoring. By incorporating autocorrelation in observations and landscape covariates, DSM provided spatially explicit estimates of moose density with greater precision and no additional field effort over traditional distance sampling. Combined with repeated surveys of areas with known moose occurrence to achieve viable sample sizes, DSM is a useful tool for effectively monitoring low density and patchy populations.},

  abstract    = {Distance sampling is a common and increasingly used method of estimating animal abundance in conservation and management programmes. The precision of a distance sampling survey can be estimated from the field data, but accuracy can only be evaluated by comparison with the true population size. For wild mammal populations, such opportunities are rare. The high-density badger Meles meles population at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire, U.K. has been routinely and intensively live-trapped for the past 30 years. The estimates of abundance based on mark-recapture analyses of the live-trapping data provided a reliable baseline against which to evaluate distance sampling for a badger population. A distance sampling survey was carried out in autumn 2002 by using spotlighting along line transects. Owing to the impractical nature of spotlighting in closed habitats, such as woodland, surveys were conducted in open habitat only. A radio-tracking study provided behavioural data that were used to estimate the proportion of the population available for sampling in open habitats. This was incorporated as a multiplier into the DISTANCE analysis. The estimate of abundance from distance sampling was 76 badgers (\% CV = 42.2), using a multiplier based on radio-tracking data from autumn only. When the multiplier was derived from radio-tracking data from across the whole year, based on a larger sample of tracked badgers, the distance sampling abundance estimate was 77 badgers (\% CV = 25.9). These compared favourably to the mark-recapture estimate of 68 badgers (\% CV = 7.4). The lack of precision in the distance sampling density estimate was largely owing to the inclusion of the multiplier. Distance sampling combined with data on habitat use can produce reliable estimates of badger abundance in areas of medium to high density, particularly in landscapes of primarily open habitat. \textcopyright{} 2005 The Zoological Society of London.},

  abstract    = {During 1997, hundreds of thousands of Short-tailed Shearwaters \emph{Puffinus tenuirostris} starved to death in the Bering Sea. We surveyed the distribution and abundance of floating carcasses during a cruise between 27 August-12 September, and estimated that over 95 000 carcasses were afloat within three survey grids covering approximately 52 400 km2. We repeatedly surveyed the same areas during two subsequent cruises in 1998 and 1999, and used standard population sampling techniques to evaluate the background levels of shearwater mortality during additional years when a die-off did not occur. The mortality event we observed in 1997 was unusual due to its extent and magnitude. During the die-off, dead shearwaters were sighted within all three survey grids. Conversely, we only encountered carcasses at one of these sites in 1998. Moreover, carcass densities in 1997 were at least one order of magnitude higher than those recorded during the following year. Surveys of seabird mortality at sea can account for floating carcasses before they are lost through advection and scavenging. Therefore, vessel-based surveys are likely to improve the accuracy of seabird mortality estimates based solely on counts of beach-cast carcasses. Here we describe the use of line transects to estimate seabird mortality at sea, and offer suggestions to standardize future surveys. Standardized surveys will improve our ability to compare the frequency, extent, and magnitude of seabird die-offs over time.},

At Pasoh Forest Reserve, a 2500 ha area of lowland dipterocarp rain forest in Peninsular Malaysia, line transects were used to estimate pig density from May to October in 1996 and 1998. In 1996, 44 sightings of S. scrofa consisting of 166 individuals were recorded along 81 km of transects. In 1998, 39 sightings documented 129 individuals along 79.9 km of transects. Estimated population density was \$47.0 pigs/km\textasciicircum 2\$ in 1996 and \$27.0 pigs/km\textasciicircum 2\$ in 1998. Sus scrofa biomass in this forest was estimated at \$1837 kg/km\textasciicircum 2\$ and \$1346 kg/km\textasciicircum 2\$ in 1996 and 1998, respectively. Differences between years were attributed to changes in the density of young pigs, coincident with a mast-seeding year of dipterocarp trees in 1996. Pig densities at Pasoh Forest Reserve were much higher than at other forest locations within the species' native range in Europe and Asia. Because Pasoh Forest Reserve is a forest fragment, two factors likely account for the extremely high pig densities: (1) local extinction of natural predators (mainly tigers and leopards) and (2) an abundant year-round food supply of African oil palm fruits from extensive plantations bordering the reserve.},

  abstract    = {1. Over the past 50 years, aerial counts have been widely used in African wildlife management; however, the accuracy of the resulting estimates has rarely been questioned. The reliability of aerial counts of large African herbivores was examined by comparing the results of a series of systematic aerial sample counts with those from a series of line transect foot counts conducted in the Lupande Game Management Area in Zambia. 2. For most large herbivore species, the estimates from the aerial counts were considerably lower than those from the ground counts. The data pointed to undercounting as a major problem of aerial surveys. During the aerial counts, significant numbers of animals were missed on the transects, first due to the low probability of spotting single animals, small groups of animals and less conspicuous ones (sighting probability bias), and secondly because part of the population was concealed by obstructions and therefore not visible to the observers (visibility bias). 3. The main factors that influence visibility of large herbivores from the air are the animals' reactions to an over-flying aircraft, dispersion, body size and colour. Animals that move in response to an aircraft are more likely to be seen than static ones; dark-coloured animals are easier to spot than light-coloured ones against a light background; large herds are easier to detect than small ones; and large animals are more easily seen than small ones. Body size is important while trying to spot grazers and mixed feeders from the air, while colour is important for spotting browsers. This is mainly due to the differences in habitat use, with browsers being confined to the thicker habitat. 4. To minimize undercounting bias, both conventional aerial counts and aerial line transect counts should be restricted to large conspicuous grazers and mixed feeders in medium to large group sizes, such as elephant Loxodonta africana africana, buffalo Sincerus caffer, zebra Equus burchell, wildebeest Connochaetes and lechwe Kobus leche. Operational factors, such as height, speed and strip width, should be kept within reasonable limits for conventional aerial counts. Only one species should be counted at a time, always applying the double-count technique. For aerial line transect counts, the use of a helicopter is a prerequisite to obtaining accurate estimates. Other important considerations are observer experience and flight duration.},

  abstract    = {Ecological densities of large herbivores were estimated using the line transect method in the tropical moist forests of Bhadra Tiger Reserve, southern India, during November 2000. The species of interest were chital \emph{Axis axis}, sambar \emph{Cervus unicolor}, muntjac \emph{Muntiacus muntjak}, gaur \emph{Bos gaurus} and Hanuman langur \emph{Presbytes entellus}. Six permanent transects, ranging from 2.6 to 3.6 km (totalling 18.2 km) were each walked 26 times. A total of 473 km was walked during the surveys. Numbers of detections were generally low (51, 25, 68, 17 and 302 for chital, sambar, muntjac, gaur and langur, respectively). Mean estimated densities of different species were [{\^D} ({$\pm$} SE)]: 4.51 ({$\pm$} 1.05) chital km-2, 0.89 ({$\pm$} 0.23) sambar km -2, 3.64 ({$\pm$} 0.63) muntjac km-2, 1.48 ({$\pm$} 0.63) gaur km-2 and 22.62 ({$\pm$} 2.64) langur km-2. Possible shortcomings of our estimates are considered and suggestions made for improving future surveys. A comparison with densities estimated for these species in other well-protected parks showed that the chital, gaur and sambar densities in Bhadra were extremely low. The main causal factors for these low densities seem to be poaching and livestock grazing.},

  abstract            = {The Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphin (Sousa chinensis Osbeck, 1765) is found throughout the western Pacific and Indian oceans, from southern China and northern Australia in the east to South Africa in the west. Throughout most of its range it has not been well studied, and in southern China very little is known of its biology. The goal of the present study was to provide scientific information needed for the longterm conservation and management of the population that occurs in Hong Kong waters. From September 1995 to November 1998, 38,105 km of systematic line transect surveys were conducted throughout marine waters of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and adjacent waters to provide data on distribution and abundance. Photo-identification of individual dolphins allowed for examination of movement patterns, home ranges, and social organization. Collection of stranded dolphin carcasses and detailed necropsies provided information on causes of death as well as samples for life history studies, such as feeding habits, growth and reproduction, ecotoxicology, and stock structure. The dolphin population appears to be centered around the Pearl River Estuary, and Hong Kong waters represent the eastern portion of the range, which extends far into mainland Chinese waters (Lingding Bay) and covers at least 1,800 km{$^2$}. Within Hong Kong, dolphins only occur in western waters around Lantau Island. The area north of Lantau Island is heavily used throughout the year and represents by far the most important habitat in Hong Kong. Line transect analyses indicate that between 88 (spring) and 145 (summer) dolphins occur in Hong Kong. Based on 27,600 photographs taken, 213 individual dolphins were identified. The total size of the Pearl River breeding population is unknown, but is estimated to consist of at least 1,028 dolphins, based on line transect analysis. An apparent decline in the number of dolphins in the North Lantau area over the period from 1996-1998 was not statistically significant. Individual dolphins have overlapping home ranges of about 30-400 km{$^2$} in different sections of the population's overall range. Groups of dolphins in Hong Kong number up to 23 animals, with an average group size of 3.8 +- s.d. 3.63 animals. There is no significant seasonal variation in group size, but groups feeding behind pair trawl fishing vessels (mean = 9.6 +- s.d. 5.37) are significantly larger than other groups, and groups in Lingding Bay, in Chinese waters west of Hong Kong (mean = 8.3 +- s.d. 7.84) are significantly larger than those in Hong Kong. Groups are very fluid and change composition frequently, with association indices ranging from 0-0.333. Behavioral patterns are similar to those of other coastal dolphins, but Hong Kong hump-backed dolphins only rarely ride bow waves. Following pair trawlers represents an important feeding strategy for some individuals. Construction work on an airport fuel facility in the dolphins' main habitat appears to have caused some disturbance (indicated by increased swimming speeds) and possibly temporary evacuation of the surrounding area. There is a great deal of developmental variation in the color pattern of southern Chinese hump-backed dolphins, with a general lightening from newborn to adult stages. Males appear to retain more spots in adulthood than females. Length at birth appears to be about 100 cm, and postnatal development is characterized by rapid growth in the first year and a levelling-off of the growth curve after reaching adulthood. Asymptotic length is reached at around 243 cm. Length and weight are related exponentially, with the maximum weight about 250 kg. Calving occurs throughout the year, but most young are born from January through August, with a peak in spring/summer. Scant evidence suggests that sexual maturity in females is reached at about 9-10 years of age. Dolphins feed mainly on several demersal and pelagic fish species that are often associated with estuaries. There is a lack of evidence for long-distance movements (on the order of hundreds of linear kilometers), and this presumably results in isolation of groups around major Chinese river mouths. Thus it appears that there may be at least 8 separate populations of hump-backed dolphins along the coast of southern China. The Pearl River Estuary, including Hong Kong, is apparently inhabited by one of these populations, although preliminary genetic work has shown only equivocal evidence of population separation from dolphins in the Xiamen area. Human-related causes of mortality include entanglement in fishing nets and vessel collisions. Some environmental contaminants (especially the heavy metal mercury and the pesticide DDT) were found in high levels in some dolphins, and preliminary evidence suggests that these may be affecting the health of the animals. A series of recommendations for management and for further research have been made to aid in the conservation of these animals. Principles for the conservation of wild living resources should be followed, and information from both the natural and social sciences are needed for proper management. Research and longterm monitoring of the population must continue for management strategies to be evaluated and refined. Overall, the population of hump-backed dolphins that occurs in Hong Kong waters appears to be viable and should be able to survive with appropriate conservation efforts.},

Three management stocks are recognized, but there is little information on their current abundance. We conducted 38,431 km of aerial line-transect surveys throughout the range of these stocks in 2013\textendash 2016, sighting a total of 4,678 groups of harbor seals. Line-transect analysis with Beaufort sea state as a covariate provided estimates of the number of seals in the water. We then incorporated tagging data from 15 instrumented seals to develop correction factors, both for seals missed in the water while diving, and those that were on shore. Tagging data were modeled with generalized linear mixed models to provide estimates of the proportions diving and hauled out. After applying these correction factors, we estimated that the Hood Canal stock contained 1,368 seals (CV = 16.8\%), the Southern Puget Sound stock contained 1,976 seals (CV = 20.5\%), and the Washington Northern Inland Waters stock contained 7,513 seals (CV = 11.5\%). This study presents a non-traditional approach to estimating the size of Washington inland waters harbor seal stocks, which may also be applicable to other species for which survey and tagging data are available.},

Their great popularity amongst herpetoculturalists has also resulted in collection for international animal markets. Most previous fieldwork has focused on the compilation of much needed species inventories, but little attention has been given to estimating chameleon population densities. This lack of information prevents a reliable assessment of the effects of habitat loss and direct exploitation on wild populations. A simple and repeatable methodology for the monitoring of chameleon populations is therefore urgently required. The present study developed survey techniques based on distance sampling within an area of relatively undisturbed rain forest at Ranomafana National Park. In total 394 individuals from six species were recorded and population densities ({$\pm$}SE) of 27.2 {$\pm$} 5.4/ha \emph{Brookesia spp}. and 21.4{$\pm$}4.0/ha \emph{Calumma spp.} were estimated using the computer program DISTANCE. The authors propose that monitoring of chameleons in areas subject to different threats should begin immediately using the methods outlined in this paper.},

The reflective characteristics of the eyes of these spiders meant that individuals were readily located using headlamps. Collections were made along transects (total length 5.5 km), adopting a distance sampling protocol. Density was estimated using distance sampling models. More than 2600 ctenids (15 species) were captured and identified. Seven of these species were present in sufficient numbers for density assessment. The combined density of these seven most common species in degraded forest fragments (0.124 m -2) was only half that in less disturbed forest (0.240 m -2).

Most criticisms involve surveys of birds, particularly those based on point counts, which is my focus here. A variety of quantitative methods have been developed to reduce the bias of point counts, such as distance sampling, multiple-observer surveys, and time-of-detection methods. I argue that these developments are valuable, in that they enhance understanding of the detection process, but that their practical application may well be limited, likely to intensive studies focusing on a small number of species. These quantitative methods are not generally applicable to extensive, multiple-species surveys. Although criticism of the thoughtless use of indices is welcome, their wholesale rejection is not.},

  abstract   = {Montane desert birds are particularly vulnerable to population declines driven by global climate change that is accelerated at higher elevations. Providing reliable and accurate information about their populations is essential for effective conservation management plans. However, few studies have compared the effectiveness of different survey methods for birds in high altitude arid environments, particularly in the Middle East. Here, we compare the reliability and precision of two sampling methods to estimate densities for two resident bird species in Egypt's Sinai mountains, the white-crowned wheatear (Oenanthe leucopyga) and desert lark (Ammomanes deserti). We conducted surveys for both species in vegetated and unvegetated desert using fixed-width strip transects and line transects using the distance sampling approach, and employed several statistical approaches to compare density estimates. While both methods provided reliable density estimates given sufficient detections of target species, strip transects exhibited more flexibility overall for estimating cryptic and rare species, which comprise a large proportion of this and other montane desert bird communities. Strip transects also entail lower effort and costs, an important consideration given research funding constraints. We therefore recommend strip transects over distance sampling for estimating bird densities in this and other arid montane regions.},

Species diversity indices were calculated from abundance estimated using density surface modeling of line-transect data. The estimated abundance ranged from 19,521 individuals in killer whale to 1,886,022 in pantropical spotted dolphin. The predicted density maps showed that the habitats of small odontocetes corresponded well with distinct oceanic domains. Species richness was estimated to be highest between 30 and 40\textdegree N where warm- and cold-water currents converge. Simpson׳s Diversity Index showed latitudinal diversity gradients of decreasing species numbers toward the poles. Higher diversity was also estimated in the coastal areas and the zonal areas around 35\textendash 42\textdegree N. Coastal\textendash offshore gradients and latitudinal gradients are known for many taxa. The zonal areas around 35\textdegree N and 40\textdegree N coincide with the Kuroshio Current and its extension and the subarctic boundary, respectively. These results suggest that the species diversity of small odontocetes primarily follows general patterns of latitudinal and longitudinal gradients, while the confluence of faunas originating in distinct water masses increases species diversify in frontal waters around 30\textendash 40\textdegree N. Population densities tended to be higher for the species inhabiting higher latitudes, but were highest for intermediate latitudes at approximately 35\textendash 40\textdegree N. According to latitudinal gradients in water temperature and biological productivity, the costs for thermoregulation will decrease in warmer low latitudes, while feeding efficiency will increase in colder high latitudes. These trade-offs could optimize population density in intermediate latitudes.},

These estimates are often unreliable due to low and variable efficiency and are inappropriate when dealing with rare or endangered species. In the marine Lake Vouliagmeni, a density surface modelling (DSM) approach using survey data from line transects, integrated with a Geographic Information System (GIS), was used to estimate the population density of the endangered fan mussel Pinna nobilis. This is the first time that such an approach has been applied for a marine benthic species. DSM was beneficial in relation to traditional distance sampling. Apart from providing a more precise total abundance estimate, it related the density of the species to spatial covariates of interest, gave a depiction of the species dispersion in the study area, and provided abundance estimates in any subregion of the study area. In Lake Vouliagmeni, a marked zonation of P. nobilis distribution was revealed, with the species being restricted in the shallow peripheral zone at depths \textexclamdown 22 m. Two density peaks were observed, a major peak at depths between 12 and 13 m and a secondary peak at  4 m. A main hotspot of high density was also observed in the northeastern part of the lake. Total abundance of the species was estimated to be 6,770 individuals with a 95\% confidence interval of 5,460\textendash 8,393 individuals.},

  abstract    = {A substantial population of the endangered Mediterranean bivalve Pinna nobilis exists in the marine Lake Vouliagmeni (Korinthiakos Gulf, Greece). The population density of P. nobilis was estimated in the lake with line transect sampling. Individuals of the youngest age class (small) had peak densities in the 1 to 3 m bathymetric zone and their densities were higher in poorly sorted sediments. Older (large) individuals (belonging to all age classes except the first one, 9 to 11 mo) had peak densities in the 11 to 13 m bathymetric zone. No P. nobilis was found deeper than 22 m. The absence of large individuals in shallow waters may partly be explained by illegal fishing. There are several hypotheses proposed to explain the lack of small individuals in deeper areas, but no definitive explanation is offered. In Lake Vouliagmeni, P. nobilis densities were high, although marine seagrass was completely absent. Thus, P. nobilis does not actually require seagrass meadows, as stated by many authors, and it may exist in large numbers in bare soft-sediment areas as well. P. nobilis grew fast, mostly during the first 3 yr of life, and may live beyond 15 yr. By recording the exact location of each P. nobilis individual within 800 m2 transects, as a pair of coordinates, the exact spatial distribution was defined and aggregation indices were calculated. P. nobilis had an aggregated dispersion, but no evidence for preferential settlement near adults or previously-settled individuals was found. The aggregated dispersion of P. nobilis probably relates to the patchiness of the local environment. The size of P. nobilis population in Lake Vouliagmeni was estimated to be 8501 {$\pm$} 4395 (mean {$\pm$} 1 SD) individuals, of which 4355 {$\pm$} 3460 belonged to the first age class and 4146 {$\pm$} 1405 belonged to all other age classes.},

We compared two widely practiced standards for counting animals - aerial strip surveys and ground line transects - with interpreted counts of animal tracks. At equal sampling intensity in semiarid savanna with good visibility all three methods produced similar population estimates and precision for six large herbivores. This comparison adds empirical support for the use of track count data to estimate population density rather than being restricted to ambiguous indices of relative abundance. Although expected to capture more species than aerial surveys, we found line transects limiting because encounter rates by direct sightings were relatively low; a minimum threshold 40 observations was achieved for only 1/3 of antelope species in 648.4 km of transect. By contrast, animal track counts returned exceedingly high encounter rates that allowed estimation of abundance for the entire large predator-prey community and mapping density-distributions more completely. Unlike aerial surveys conducted by Botswana's wildlife authority, the track survey provided opportunity to involve local people in the research process. The track survey cost 40\% less than the aerial survey, and could be reduced a further 3-fold if trackers collected data autonomously without motor vehicles. Counting animals by their tracks is ultimately constrained to regions with appropriate substrates. However, in suitable environments like the Kalahari, we suggest that a citizen science driven by expert local trackers could ultimately replace conventional wildlife counts, generating knock-on benefits to conservation beyond improved data.},

Assuming perfect detection introduces bias into estimation that can weaken inference upon which understanding and policy are based. Despite availability of numerous methods designed to address this assumption, many refereed papers in ecology fail to account for non-detection error. We conducted a quantitative literature review of 537 ecological articles to measure the degree to which studies of different taxa, at various scales, and over time have accounted for imperfect detection. Overall, just 23\% of articles accounted for imperfect detection. The probability that an article incorporated imperfect detection increased with time and varied among taxa studied; studies of vertebrates were more likely to incorporate imperfect detection. Among articles that reported detection probability, 70\% contained per-survey estimates of detection that were less than 0.5. For articles in which constancy of detection was tested, 86\% reported significant variation. We hope that our findings prompt more ecologists to consider carefully the detection process when designing studies and analyzing results, especially for sub-disciplines where incorporation of imperfect detection in study design and analysis so far has been lacking.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown},

  abstract    = {Abundance estimation in ecology is usually accomplished by capture-recapture, removal, or distance sampling methods. These may be hard to implement at large spatial scales. In contrast, binomial mixture models enable abundance estimation without individual identification, based simply on temporally and spatially replicated counts. Here, we evaluate mixture models using data from the national breeding bird monitoring program in Switzerland, where some 250 1-km2 quadrats are surveyed using the territory mapping method three times during each breeding season. We chose eight species with contrasting distribution (wide-narrow), abundance (high-low), and detectability (easy-difficult). Abundance was modeled as a random effect with a Poisson or negative binomial distribution, with mean affected by forest cover, elevation, and route length. Detectability was a logit-linear function of survey date, survey date-by-elevation, and sampling effort (time per transect unit). Resulting covariate effects and parameter estimates were consistent with expectations. Detectability per territory (for three surveys) ranged from 0.66 to 0.94 (mean 0.84) for easy species, and from 0.16 to 0.83 (mean 0.53) for difficult species, depended on survey effort for two easy and all four difficult species, and changed seasonally for three easy and three difficult species. Abundance was positively related to route length in three high-abundance and one low-abundance (one easy and three difficult) species, and increased with forest cover in five forest species, decreased for two nonforest species, and was unaffected for a generalist species. Abundance estimates under the most parsimonious mixture models were between 1.1 and 8.9 (median 1.8) times greater than estimates based on territory mapping; hence, three surveys were insufficient to detect all territories for each species. We conclude that binomial mixture models are an important new approach for estimating abundance corrected for detectability when only repeated-count data are available. Future developments envisioned include estimation of trend, occupancy, and total regional abundance. \textcopyright{} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

  abstract  = {Estimating population density and population dynamics is essential for understanding primate ecology and relies on robust methods. While distance sampling theory provides a robust framework for estimating animal abundance, implementing a constrained, non-systematic transect design could bias density estimates. Here, we assessed potential bias associated with line distance sampling surveys along roads based on a case study with olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Lake Manyara National Park (Tanzania). This was achieved by comparing density estimates of olive baboons derived from road transect surveys with density estimates derived from estimating the maximum number of social groups (via sleeping site counts) and multiplying this metric with the estimated average size of social groups. From 2011 to 2019, we counted olive baboons along road transects, estimated survey-specific densities in a distance sampling framework, and assessed temporal population trends. Based on the fitted half-normal detection function, the mean density was 132.5 baboons km-2 (95\% CI: 110.4\textendash 159.2), however, detection models did not fit well due to heaping of sightings on and near the transects. Density estimates were associated with relatively wide confidence intervals that were mostly caused by encounter rate variance. Based on a generalized additive model, baboon densities were greater during the rainy seasons compared to the dry seasons but did not show marked annual trends. Compared to estimates derived from the alternative method (sleeping site survey), distance sampling along road transects overestimated the abundance of baboons more than threefold. Possibly, this overestimation was caused by the preferred use of roads by baboons. While being a frequently used technique (due to its relative ease of implementation compared to spatially randomized survey techniques), inferring population density of baboons (and possibly other species) based on road transects should be treated with caution. Beyond these methodological concerns and considering only the most conservative estimates, baboon densities in LMNP are among the highest across their geographic distribution range.},

Wildlife opening management, involving repeatedly burning or mechanically treating early-successional stands, is one strategy for creating habitat for these species, but this practice is costly. Some silvicultural treatments also create scrub-shrub habitat and have the advantage of potentially generating revenue, but the relative effectiveness of wildlife opening management and silviculture for creating bird habitat is not known. During 2004 and 2005, we compared scrub-shrub bird abundance, nest success, and habitat characteristics between wildlife and silvicultural openings in western Massachusetts to determine whether the habitats created by these practices are equivalent for birds. We recorded 1927 detections of 31 scrub-shrub bird species during the course of the study and monitored 368 nests. We found that although most species were present in both treatments, many differed in abundance between wildlife and silvicultural openings, including several species of high conservation concern. These differences were attributable to differences in habitat characteristics between treatments. The overall probability of a nest surviving to fledging was 0.43, and did not differ between wildlife and silvicultural openings. Our results indicate that the habitat quality of wildlife and silvicultural openings is not equivalent for scrub-shrub birds, but the two management approaches serve as complementary strategies for maintaining these declining species.},

We present SIAFOR, a computer programme for the calculation of four nearest-neighbour indices, which describe the spatial arrangement of tree positions, the distribution pattern of species, and the size differentiation between trees. The study uses SIAFOR as a sampling simulator in eight completely stem-mapped forest stands of varying area and structural complexity. We statistically evaluate two sample types (distance and plot sampling), comparing sampling error, bias and minimum sample size for index estimation. We introduce the concepts of measurement expansion factor (MEF) and design expansion factor (DEF) for the technical evaluation of sample type efficiency (optimal sample type). Results indicate that sampling error can reach high levels and that minimum sample sizes for index estimation often amply exceed the limit of 20\% of tree density or 20 trees per species per hectare, that we set as the highest feasible sample size in normal situations. We found clear feasibility limits (in terms of minimal tree densities and reachable accuracy levels) for the estimation of all investigated indices. Generally, equal or higher sample sizes are needed for plot sampling than for distance sampling to reach equal accuracy levels. Nevertheless, plot sampling resulted more efficient for the estimation of tree size differentiation at low to medium accuracy levels. For all other investigated indices distance sampling resulted more efficient than plot sampling. Minimum sample size increases with accuracy and is negatively correlated with tree density. At a given accuracy level minimum sample size is highest for the estimation of relative mingling and lowest for tree size differentiation; furthermore it is generally lower in large stands than in small ones. Because of the consistency of our conclusions in all of the investigated stands, we think they apply in most stands of similar area (between 1 and 10 ha) and species diversity (not more than four species). \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We developed a technique that combines distance and double-observer sampling to estimate detection probabilities and effective area surveyed. We applied this paired-observer, variable circular-plot (POVCP) technique to point-count surveys (n = 753) conducted in closed-canopy forests of southeast Alaska. Distance data were analyzed for each species to model a detection probability for each observer and calculate an estimate of density. We then multiplied each observer's density estimates by a correction factor to adjust for detection probabilities \textexclamdown 1 at plot center. We compared analytical results from four survey methods: single-observer fixed-radius (50-m) plot; single-observer, variable circular-plot (SOVCP); double-observer fixed-radius (50-m) plot; and POVCP. We examined differences in detection probabilities at plot center, effective area surveyed, and densities for five bird species: Pacific-slope Flycatcher \emph{(Empidonax difficilis)}, Winter Wren \emph{(Troglodytes troglodytes)}, Golden-crowned Kinglet \emph{(Regulus satrapa)}, Hermit Thrush \emph{(Catharus guttatus)}, and Townsend's Warbler \emph{(Dendroica townsendi)}. Average detection probabilities for paired observers increased ?8\% (SE = 2.9) for all species once estimates were corrected for birds missed at plot center. Density estimators of fixed-radius survey methods were likely negatively biased, because the key assumption of perfect detection was not met. Density estimates generated using SOVCP and POVCP were similar, but standard errors were much lower for the POVCP survey method. We recommend using POVCP when study objectives require precise estimates of density. Failure to account for differences in detection probabilities and effective area surveyed results in biased population estimators and, therefore, faulty inferences about the population in question. \textcopyright{} The American Ornithologists' Union, 2006.},

  abstract   = {Line-transect distance sampling is widely used to estimate population densities using distances of observed targets from transect lines to model detectability. When the target taxa are high density, the frequent measuring of distances may make the method seem impractical. We present a method that improves the efficiency of distance sampling when the target species occurs at high density. Only a proportion of targets are measured to model the detection function, and the time saved on the survey is then used to cover a longer total length of transect and accrue a larger `count only' sample. This approach can improve the precision of the population density estimate when the cost of measuring the distance to a detected target is more than half the cost of walking to the next target. We find the optimal proportion of distances to measure that minimises the variance of the density estimate for a fixed survey budget. We quantify how much this optimised strategy increases the precision of the density estimate compared with conventional line-transect distance sampling. We then use simulated distance sampling data to test our expressions, and illustrate circumstances under which the optimised approach would be beneficial using distance sampling data on high-density plants. The simulations indicate that the optimised method delivers benefits in precision, but the magnitude of the benefit is lower than predicted from our expressions, which are based on an asymptotic approximation of the variance. We apply an adjustment to the predicted benefit equation to account for this difference, and show that, in all three plant case studies, the optimised approach could improve the precision gained from a distance sampling survey between 20\% and 50\%. This new approach could broaden the ecological contexts in which distance sampling is applied, to include estimation of densities of abundant taxa where plots are conventionally used. The method may have interesting applications for other survey types, including multispecies surveys or those using cues or signs that occur at high density.},

Density of females was greater than males (0.9 [0.3] and 0.03 [0.04], respectively) for all seasons combined. We found that placement of points, detecting deer at points, and not forcing deer to move from their initial location were interrelated and a function of mule deer behavior and how we approached points. Our ability to measure distances accurately was improved greatly by using distance test courses and calibration points throughout the refuge. Important considerations in using distance sampling include: 1) careful evaluation of study design; 2) establishment of permanent survey points to be used throughout time, which aids in field operations and analysis; 3) development and use of a distance test course and calibration points to train observers, practice measuring distances, and calibrate equipment; 4) development of standardized protocol to maintain consistent data collection among observers and over time; and 5) incorporation of a thorough understanding of the target species' behavior and ecology into the survey design.},

  abstract = {Counts of independent photo events from camera traps are commonly used to make inference about species occupancy, the density of unmarked populations, and the relative abundance of species across time and space. These applications rest on the untested assumption that data collected from individual cameras are representative of the landscape location in which they are placed, and that nearby cameras would record similar data when any additional micro-site differences are accounted for. We established a high-density camera trapping grid (100 \texttimes{} 100 m; 27 cameras) in Virginia, USA, to explicitly test these assumptions, investigating variation in capture rates and detection probabilities for a range of terrestrial mammals during four 2-month seasonal surveys. Despite controlling for numerous habitat and placement factors, we documented, across all 5 focal species, large ranges and coefficients of variation in both capture rate and detection probabilities, which were similar to those seen across 2 sets of independent forest sampling sites from a larger, more typical camera trap sampling design. We also documented a lack of spatial autocorrelation in capture rate at any distance. Measured local covariates relevant to the camera viewshed (stem density, camera height, log presence, effective detection distance [EDD], total dbh of oak trees) rarely explained any significant portion of observed variation in capture rates or detection probabilities across the grid. The influence of EDD, measured here for the first time for individual camera stations, was inconsistently important and varied in direction of effect depending on species and season. Our study indicates single-camera stations may fail to sample animal presence and frequency of use in a robust and repeatable way, primarily resulting from the influence of both idiosyncrasies in animal movement and measured and unknown micro-site characteristics. We recommend spatial replication within sites (e.g., small-scale shifting of cameras or use of multiple stations) should be considered to minimize impacts of relevant micro-site characteristics, some of which may be difficult to identify.},

  abstract    = {Hunting is the major driver of large mammal decline in Central African forests. In slowly reproducing species even low hunting pressure leaves spatial gradients with wildlife density increasing with distance from transport routes and human settlements. Park management can use this pattern formation to identify sources of threats, but also to discriminate between different threat scenarios, such as the impact of subsistence vs. commercial hunting. We conducted an ape survey in the mountainous Moukalaba Doudou National Park, Gabon, to evaluate whether potential population gradients would emanate from the three human population centers in the region or the villages surrounding the park. Using generalized linear modeling we found hill slope as a good predictor of ape nest occurrence probability and the distance to human population centers a better predictor of ape nest density and ape nest group size than distance to villages. In fact ape nest density was three times lower at the park borders close to the human population centers than in the park's interior. The results indicate that Moukalaba's ape population is more impacted by commercial than subsistence hunting and suggest that park management should focus conservation efforts on the human population centers. We conclude that in particular for slowly reproducing species geographic information on wildlife population gradients are of additional value for guiding protected area management. The hunting impact on those species might be easily underestimated, if derived only from market surveys or transport route controls, where they are only rarely found.},

  abstract    = {Underwater visual censuses are the most commonly used methods to estimate the density of reef fish populations and assemblages. One basic assumption is that the observer will always detect fish in the same way from one sampling unit to the next, implying that, on average, the spatial distribution pattern of fish abundance or occurrence remains the same from one transect to the next (H0). The present work tested H0 using data from 730 transects covering two regions (New Caledonia and French Polynesia), 604 species and 504\^A 000 fish. Within transect variations in reef fish abundance and occurrence were studied according to site factors (region, reef type), life-history traits (adult size, home range, schooling behaviour, color, pattern, swimming speed, level in the water column, inquisitiveness, crypticity), and observations characteristics (distance of observation, size of the observed fishes, number of fishes within an observation, observer identity). Two general trends were detected: 1 \textendash{} at the start of transects, both fish occurrence and abundance were higher than the values expected under H0; 2 \textendash{} a similar trend was also observed at the end of transects, but at a much lower magnitude. These effects were observed with varying degrees of magnitude for all regions, reef types and observers, varied significantly according to three life-history traits (size, home range, and behaviour), but were not influenced by species richness or abundance. These results indicate that datasets gathered from transects of various lengths cannot be pooled without correction. They also shed light on some of the known differences between transects and point counts.},

  abstract = {Effective wildlife management requires information on population status and distribution. Survey methods that provide estimates of these population parameters can vary greatly in effort required, area covered, precision of estimates, and cost. Trade-offs are required, because increasing precision and area coverage generally requires increasing field effort and incurs a higher cost. We compare DNA- and camera trap based-spatial capture-recapture approaches (DNA-SCR and CT-SCR) to the widely-used, dung-based line transect distance sampling (LTDS) method to assess their performance when applied to three relatively large populations of forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis ({$>$}500 individuals), in order to evaluate their feasibility for future use at national and regional scales. Six of the nine surveys had a coefficient of variation below 20\%; area coverage via DNA-SCR and LTDS was comparable and greatly exceeded that of the CT-SCR as applied; overall cost was highest for the LTDS surveys compared to the other two methods. We designed a new metric with which to compare survey methods: an integrated feasibility index (IFI). This combines three typical survey components: total area covered, level of precision achieved, and cost. The IFI suggests that DNA-SCR and LTDS are equally acceptable in terms of the combination of the three survey components, and that either survey method is suitable for large (national or regional) spatial scales for forest elephant density estimation. CT-SCR provides more precise estimates, but has double the IFI, due to the high cost per km2. DNA-SCR in particular, given the improvements highlighted in this study, is now being used at a national scale in Gabon. In conclusion, we recommend that the use of these spatial capture-recapture (SCR) methods, and their development, continue. Future findings and improvements should be compiled across studies to ensure their robust evolution as an option for monitoring the African forest elephant across its range and inform strategies and action for its conservation.},

  abstract    = {The Diego Ramirez Islands lie 60 nautical miles southwest of Cape Horn and are the breeding site for three species of burrowing seabirds: blue petrels \emph{(Halobaena caerulea)}, common diving petrels \emph{(Pelecanoides urinatrix)} and sooty shearwater \emph{(Puffinus griseus)}. Burrowing seabirds are highly vulnerable to predation by introduced vertebrate pests, and Diego Ramirez is an important breeding site because it is one of a few remaining subantarctic island groups with no introduced predators. Diego Ramirez is the only known breeding site for blue petrels in the southeast Pacific region, holding about 80\% of the global population of that species, and with a population ten times larger than any other population in the world. We estimated the population size in 2002, using a novel application of the distance sampling technique to determine burrow density, and a burrow-scope with excavations to determine occupying species. We found that density was correlated with slope angle and soil wetness. Burrow densities in flatter terrain with drier soils were 2.03 burrows/m2 (95\% confidence intervals: 1.82-2.27) and 1.11 burrows/m2 (0.84-1.48) in steeper terrain with wetter soils. The occupation rate of burrows were significantly different between habitat types (t = 2.74, d.f. 11, P \textexclamdown{} 0.05); in flatter drier habitats the proportion of burrows that led to a nest was 0.85 (0.74-0.96), in steeper wetter habitats this decreased to 0.64 (0.50-0.78). We used a digital elevation model to calculate true area rather than planar area for the two habitat types on the main island of Bartolome, and charts to calculate planar area for the remainder of the archipelago. There were 1.35 (1.15-1.54) million pairs of blue petrels and 99,000 (65,000-134,000) pairs of common diving petrels on the archipelago. These are similar figures to those from the only previous estimate, made in 1980. We found breeding sooty shearwaters for the first time, and estimated a population of several thousand pairs. We emphasise the facility of distance sampling as an unbiased technique with practical advantages over commonly used area search methods for monitoring populations of burrowing seabirds. These advantages include increased survey efficiency allowing a larger sample size for a given effort and a correspondingly tighter estimation of density. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

  abstract    = {Although point transect distance sampling methods have become widely used in surveys of forest birds, there has been no attempt to tailor field methods to maximize the accuracy of abundance estimates by minimizing the effects of violations of the method's critical assumptions, which are: (1) birds at distance 0 m are detected with certainty, (2) birds are detected at their initial location and (3) distances to objects are measured accurately. We investigate the effects on abundance estimates for Philippine forest birds of varying the count period from 2 to 10 min, and of including and excluding a pre-count settling down period. Encounter rates were highly sensitive to count period length but density estimates from 10-min count periods were, on average, only 13\% higher than those from 2-min periods, and in several cases were actually lower than those from periods of 6-8 min. This was because birds tended to be recorded at greater distances from the recorder as the count period went on, thus \^a\texteuro\texttildelow stretching out\^a\texteuro\texttrademark{} detection functions while having little effect on detection rates close to the recorder. For some bird groups, including canopy frugivores and upperstorey gleaning insectivores, density estimates were more than twice as high without than with a settling down period. We suggest that movement away from the recorder is more common than attraction to the recorder, and that unless pilot studies show otherwise, similar studies should not use a settling down period for surveying many species. Count periods that maximized probability of bird detection close to the central point while minimizing the unwanted effects of bird movement during the count period were: 4 min for omnivores, 6 min for nectarivores and upperstorey gleaning insectivores, 8 min for understorey insectivores and canopy frugivores, and a full 10 min for sallying insectivores, ground-dwellers, carnivores and coucals/koels. We use the results to suggest \^a\texteuro\texttildelow group-specific\^a\texteuro\texttrademark{} count period regimes that could help maximize the accuracy of density estimates from similar studies of tropical forest birds.},

  abstract  = {Reliable population abundance estimates are invaluable to wildlife management programs. Mark-recapture techniques are regarded as the gold standard for estimating abundance but can be financially or logistically prohibitive. Recent developments in remote camera analytical approaches have provided alternative methods to estimate unmarked populations efficiently but have undergone limited field testing. In September and October 2020, I assessed 2 camera methods that use the same set of time-lapse photographs; a space to event (STE) model and instantaneous sampling (IS), applied to a case study of feral sheep (Ovis aries) at the US Army's P\=ohakuloa Training Area (PTA) on Hawai`i Island. Results of the camera methods were compared to an abundance estimate calculated from an aerial distance sampling survey completed concurrently with camera sampling. A comparison of confidence intervals indicated no statistical difference between estimates, but the relative imprecision of IS suggested the STE model to be a more reliable estimator. The cost of camera sampling was approximately 3 times that of the aerial survey, but camera sampling became more economical if the area was resurveyed 3 or more times. My study showed the STE model to be a cost effective, practical abundance estimator of feral sheep when compared to well-established aerial distance sampling techniques, and therefore should offer considerable potential for the conservation and management of other easily identifiable species.},

In forests with random spatial patterns, n-tree distance sampling density estimators are at least as precise as those of plot sampling if the fixed-radius plot size is less than the ratio of (n - 2) and the expected density, where n is the number of trees included at an n-tree location. A similar result holds for the clustered forest, where the ratio is multiplied by a factor involving a constant of heterogeneity. If the expected number of trees per plot and the plot sizes are the same for both the random and clustered spatial patterns, the variance of the plot sampling density estimator for the clustered pattern will always be greater than for that of the random spatial pattern.},

  abstract    = {Grasslands in South Africa have been extensively transformed and fragmented, but are poorly protected. Commercial afforestation poses a particular threat to grassland biodiversity because areas suitable for forestry coincide with those supporting the greatest richness of endemic and threatened biota. To comply with international forestry standards, commercial timber growers leave "ecological networks" of interconnected open corridors within plantations: however, the value of these networks for conservation is unclear. This study investigated how bird community composition, richness and density were influenced by habitat extent, connectivity and quality in a grassland ecological network in a forestry plantation in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We surveyed birds and measured local vegetation characteristics throughout the network. There were at least five open habitat types within the network and bird communities responded clearly to differences between these habitats: all network communities showed a distinct shift away from those typical of control grasslands. There were three distinct groups of species in the network: (1) grassland specialists, (2) habitat generalists and (3) non-grassland species. Grassland specialists were restricted to areas that are burned regularly and to large, contiguous open areas or wide grassland corridors. We found no evidence for the importance of physical connectivity among open habitats for birds in the study area. Instead, it appears that the establishment of so-called ecological networks at this scale has created much unsuitable habitat for grassland specialist species. We suggest consolidation of open areas and a rotational, biennial burning regime as a more appropriate management strategy for commercial plantations in these Critically Endangered montane grasslands.},

A combination of distance sampling census methods and direct counts was used for the census in five sites located along the Rio Madre de Dios and Rio Tambopata. All five sites consisted of different forest types with significantly different habitat components. Three of these sites were classified as primary forest habitats whilst the remaining two were classified as disturbed forests. Population densities were calculated for eight of the threatened species recorded during the census. Density estimates of non-bamboo specialists were higher in primary forest habitats than in disturbed forest habitats. Density estimates of most bamboo specialists were higher in primary Old Floodplain forest with extensive bamboo understorey than in primary Middle/Upper Floodplain forest with smaller, patchy areas of bamboo understorey. Calculation of regional population estimates based on the amount of forest cover from satellite photographs shows that only two of the threatened bird species have substantial populations currently protected by the Parque Nacional Bahuaja-Sonene and Reservada Nacional de Tambopata. Selective logging operations that reduce overall tree biomass and remove a large proportion of palm tree species from primary forest habitats will have an adverse affect on local populations of four of the threatened bird species in the region. \textcopyright{} BirdLife International 2004.},

In general, species were more abundant in primary old floodplain or primary middle/upper floodplain forests than in primary seasonally flooded swamp forest. Density estimates were also higher than those calculated from traditional spot-mapping methods in other lowland forest sites in southeastern Peru and French Guiana. There was no significant difference in the number of individual owls recorded during nights with different cloud cover or during different phases of the moon. Problems of distance estimation at night and unfamiliarity with a range of vocalizations, particularly with Strix owls, may be overcome by conducting a practice period before surveys are undertaken, with transect routes and distance markers adequately set out. Walking transect routes during daylight hours in a practice period also helps to overcome concerns of observer safety.},

Three habitat types were found along the various transects (mature rain forest (MF), secondary rain forest (SF), swamp forest (SW)). The detection probabilities for these vipers were modelled with a set of competing models, and the various models were ordered by Akaike Information Criterion procedures. Two classes of models were used: the single-season model, and the multi-species model. The best models (single-season model) suggested that: for the Gaboon viper, habitat types SF and SW were particularly important in detecting this species, especially during the rainy season at 08h00-16h00. For nose-horned vipers, the best models had SW and MF as site-covariates. Application of the multi-species model revealed that there were different detection functions if both species are present at a site, with a 'negative' interaction of occupancy between the species. Females and males were similarly detectable in a logistic regression model, but feeding status and pregnancy slightly increased detection probability in a logistic regression model. Viper density was modelled by a DISTANCE sampling procedure. The density of one species tended to be inversely correlated to the density of the other, suggesting that (1) the rain-forest environment does not support abundant populations of both vipers when sympatric, and (2) the two Bitis species subtly partition the habitat resources.

  abstract    = {Distance sampling techniques were compared to point (variable plot) sampling and fixed-radius circular plot sampling for inventory of teak \emph{(Tectona grandis)} plantations in Indonesia. n-tree distance sampling selects the n trees closest to a sample point located in the field. The distance to the nth closest tree is used as a plot radius. Two n-tree estimators were compared. Prodan (1968) described a technique for n=6, which counts the nth tree as 1/2 for tree counts and tree volume (or other tree attributes). Another approach, here called 'the (n-1)/n adjusted estimator' uses the bias correction factor (n-1)/n. Eberhardt (1967) demonstrated that the (n-1)/n adjusted estimator is unbiased for Poisson (random) and negative binomial (clumped) spatial distributions. No proof of unbiasedness is known for either method in uniform distributions which would be characteristics of plantations. n-tree sampling was performed in Indonesian teak plantations for values of n ranging from 3 to 10 for both methods. At the same locations, point (variable plot) samples with metric basal area factors 1 m2 ha-1 tree-1 and 2 m2 ha-1 tree-1 and fixed-radius circular plots 0.1 ha in size were installed for comparison with the n-tree distance methods. The time required for each sampling method was recorded at each field location. For each method, an efficiency ratio was calculated as (C(k)/2 x Time(k))/(C(0.1 ha)/2 x Time(0.1 ha)) where C(k) is the coefficient of variation for method k, Time(k) is the average time required for method k, C(0.1 ha) is the coefficient of variation for 0.1 ha plots and Time(0.1 ha) is the average time required for 0.1 ha plots. The more efficient methods have smaller efficiency ratios. According to this criterion, 5-tree distance sampling using Prodan's estimator was most efficient of the techniques compared that did not show bias for these data. The (n-1)/n adjusted estimator showed bias for these trials in teak plantations. This was probably due to the uniform spatial distribution characteristics of plantations. Point sampling with BAF=1 m2 ha-1 tree-1 and BAF=2 m2 ha-1 tree-1 and 0.1 ha plot sampling were not as efficient as n-tree sampling methods for these trials.},

  abstract    = {A shipboard cetacean survey was conducted in July/August 1998 within an area to the west of Scotland, UK, commonly known as the Atlantic Frontier. The aim of the survey was to document the distribution and abundance of cetaceans to provide baseline population data for an area that is being increasingly explored and developed by oil companies. A double platform `independent observer' (IO) method was used to estimate the abundance of the Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus) using standard line-transect and distance sampling methodology. Previously, uncorrected Atlantic white-sided dolphin abundance was estimated as 27,194 (CV = 0.29) from this survey. This paper presents abundance estimates corrected for g(0) \textexclamdown{} 1 using a direct duplicate method. The value of g(0) was estimated to be 0.61 (CV = 0.09). The abundance in two strata was estimated as 21,371 (CV = 0.54) to the west of the Outer Hebrides and74,626 (CV = 0.72) in the Faroe Shetland Channel. The high CVs are the result of small sample sizes, particularly of the duplicate data set. However, the abundance estimates represent the first for this species to the northwest of Scotland and adds to existing baseline abundance estimates for small cetaceans in UK waters. The results could be useful for planning future surveys that aim to calculate more precise abundance estimates. These results, together with opportunistic sightings data collected during other surveys, suggest that the waters to the west of Scotland are an important habitat for the Atlantic white-sided dolphin. Presently, threats to this species in the area are relatively unknown but a baseline population estimate will be an integral part of any management regime should there become a need in future.},

  abstract    = {To determine which sampling method may be best employed to monitor changes in fish species composition in littoral areas of small north temperate lakes (50 ha), data were collected using distance sampling, based on the line transect method, and a traditional fish sampling method of baited minnow traps. These methods were independently biased in terms of their estimates of species presence and abundance. However, analyses of fish community structure indicated that minnow trap data alone provided a better measure of community structure than did distance sampling data alone. Distance sampling, although a powerful tool in estimating population density, is hindered by a multitude of environmental variables that do not preclude the use of minnow traps. Lakes with clear water containing few species with abundant individuals are best suited for distance sampling. Minnow traps proved to be a fast, efficacious sampling method capable of fairly accurately defining the littoral small-fish community structure in most lakes sampled. These traps are a reliable method for monitoring presence or absence and relative abundance of small-bodied fish species in north temperate lakes. However, the combination of minnow traps and some form of visual sampling will help to ensure that all species are detected in small north temperate lakes. \textcopyright{} 2006 NRC.},

The estimation of a resource selection function is usually based on the comparison of a sample of resource units used by an animal with a sample of the resource units that were available for use, with both samples being assumed to be e.ectively randomly selected from the relevant populations. In this paper the possibility of using a modi.ed sampling scheme is examined, with the used units obtained by line transect sampling. A logistic regression type of model is proposed, with estimation by conditional maximum likelihood. A simulation study indicates that the model in its full generality may be di.cult to estimate with reasonable sample sizes, but that a simpler version may be a practical alternative.},

  abstract    = {Line transect sampling is one of the most widely used methods for animal abundance assessment. Standard estimation methods assume certain detection on the transect, no animal movement, and no measurement errors. Failure of the assumptions can cause substantial bias. In this work, the effect of error measurement on line transect estimators is investigated. Based on considerations of the process generating the errors, a multiplicative error model is presented and a simple way of correcting estimates based on knowledge of the error distribution is proposed. Using beta models for the error distribution, the effect of errors and of the proposed correction is assessed by simulation. Adequate confidence intervals for the corrected estimates are obtained using a bootstrap variance estimate for the correction and the delta method. As noted by Chen (1998, Biometrics 54, 899-908), even unbiased estimators of the distances might lead to biased density estimators, depending on the actual error distribution. In contrast with the findings of Chen, who used an additive model, unbiased estimation of distances, given a multiplicative model, lead to over-estimation of density. Some error distributions result in observed distance distributions that make efficient estimation impossible, by removing the shoulder present in the original detection function. This indicates the need to improve field methods to reduce measurement error. An application of the new methods to a real data set is presented.},

  abstract    = {The suitability of point count distance methods for estimating densities of tropical parrots and hornbills was assessed during surveys in Indonesia. The methods will perform well, so long as the following are considered. (1) Enough bird records must be accumulated to model species' detection curves precisely. For some species, around 2000 point counts may be needed and, in very rare species, the method may not be appropriate. Pooling data across habitats, species or years may increase precision in cases of small sample size. (2) Point counts are likely to be less biased than line transects because bird detection rates close to the recorder may be higher and there may be less chance of double-counting birds. Distances greater than 400 m between census points are unnecessary. (3) Count periods lasting ten minutes may be needed to ensure that most birds close to the recorder are detected. Controlled flushing of concealed birds after the main count period may also be appropriate. (4) The best time of day for census is the period when bird detectability is high but bird mobility low. For many large avian frugivores, this corresponds to the period between one hour after dawn and 10.30 h. (5) Records of flying birds must be excluded from density calculations. In the species studied, between 2\% and 20\% should be added to density estimates to compensate for the exclusion of flying birds.},

  abstract    = {In comparison with other tropical forest land uses such as selective logging, little is known of the impacts on wildlife of the many forms of small-scale agriculture practised across the tropics. We present density estimates, derived using a point count distance sampling method, for 31 bird species in primary forest, old abandoned gardens and active/recently abandoned gardens at two altitudes in the Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area (CMWMA), Papua New Guinea. There were clear habitat differences between the six habitat/altitude categories, with, for example, clines in tree sizes and canopy cover from highest values in primary forest to lowest values in current gardens. At lower altitudes, primary forest held highest densities of most species, whereas at higher altitudes, old abandoned gardens had greater densities of many birds, especially insectivores. canoco was used to ordinate bird species with respect to major habitat gradient axes. Major axes were associated with differences in bird responses to forest conversion as well as altitudinal differences in species composition. Most important was that several insectivores (especially monarchs, fantails, etc.) formed a cluster of species associated with intact, high-biomass forest. We suggest that most species reacted moderately to habitat changes currently occurring, and this may be due in part to the fact that only a small proportion of the landscape at CMWMA has been converted to agriculture (around 13\% may be current or recently abandoned gardens). There were, however, species with comparatively low densities in agricultural habitats and these included several insectivores, the terrestrial Blue Jewel-babbler Ptilorrhoa caerulescens, and three out of four birds of paradise. \textcopyright{} 2006 The Authors.},

Counts were carried out in two years using driven line transects, and correlated with vegetation type and the variables using generalised linear models. The offset was a surveyed area estimated using Distance Sampling Theory as a means of correcting for detectability bias. More rabbits were observed in dense vegetation during day-time counts and in crops during night-time counts, In 1998, day-time counts were higher with higher average daily temperatures, whilst the night-time counts were higher with higher minimum daily temperatures. In 1999, day-time counts decreased with the amount of rainfall in the previous month, and the night-time counts decreased with the accumulated rainfall in the previous two months and with the higher wind speeds. In order to increase efficacy, counts should be carried out either at dawn or at dusk during the post-breeding season, and with greater intensity in dense scrub or open vegetation with high tree cover. During the breeding season and winter, counts should be carried out after dusk and with greater intensity in arable crops.},

Higher population densities were found in shrub dominated than in grass dominated sites, regardless of past methamidophos exposure.

We conducted six surveys here within three divisions (north, south, beach) along 32 randomly selected fixed-width plots (25 \texttimes{} 4 m) from August to October 2002. The total weighted mean population estimate, using a conservative procedure, was 183 lizards. The number of lizards was positively associated with a greater number of shrub stems. Lizards were more abundant in forested areas in the southern half of the cay (81\% of the weighted total), but scarcer than expected on beaches (\textexclamdown{} 0.05\% of the total), especially treeless areas. Since our recent population estimate suggests a decline in the long-term (ca. 35 yr) population of \emph{Ameiva polops} on Green Cay, mark-resight, recapture surveys, or distance sampling (adjusted for the proportion of animals that are unobserved) are required to obtain population estimates and to assess hurricane effects (since Hugo in 1989) on habitat structure and composition.

To test this hypothesis we collected songbird point count data across broad biophysical gradients and gradients in forest patch edge density in the west and east slopes of the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and Washington, U.S.A., which differ in ecological productivity. We then analyzed bird response (75 species) at both the species and community level to gradients in edge density (m/ha) of open and closed-canopy forest within 1-km radius landscapes. We found that (1) differences in vegetation and structural conditions between open and closed-canopy stands were significantly greater at a highly productive landscape than a landscape with intermediate levels of productivity; (2) more bird species responded to changes in edge density in more productive west-slope Cascade forests than less productive east-side Cascade forests; (3) pooled abundance data from both sites showed that 25 of the 60 most abundant bird species responded significantly to the interaction between forest productivity and changes in landscape-level edge density; and, (4) at the community level, ordinations showed that bird community similarity in the productive west-slope Cascade forests differed across low and high levels of edge density whereas no such differentiation occurred in harsh, east-side Cascade forests. These results provide some of the first evidence supporting the hypothesis that edge effects are more pronounced in productive west-side forests where higher levels of edge density benefit generalist and open-canopy species while negatively influencing closed-canopy species. Consequently, forest management aimed at supporting species diversity will be most effective if tailored to ecosystem productivity.},

  abstract  = {We used the distance detection function from five-minute point counts entirely within large woody vegetation patches to derive a method of truncating counts of birds detected close to the observer to estimate their relative abundance in small habitat patches. Our method trades off loss of information by truncation of bird sightings at successively larger distances from the observer to reduce sampling bias. Truncation of counts to include detections within 10 m of the observer gave similar absolute density as distance methods for the six most abundant native and six introduced species. Distance analysis showed that introduced species were in general more conspicuous than New Zealand native species. Use of counts very close to the observer reduces detectability biases for species and habitat comparisons to give more robust measures of community structure, allows inclusion of very small habitat fragments into the analysis, and provides a density measure for infrequently encountered species. However, the counts are still best treated as relative indices rather than absolute density estimates. Much of the international literature using counts and distance sampling estimation methods to claim increased bird diversity and abundance in larger habitat patches may be unreliable because these include directional biased estimation of abundance in small patches.},

  abstract   = {Accurate and ecologically relevant wildlife population estimates are critical for species management. One of the most common survey methods for forest mammals \textendash{} line transects for animal sign with distance sampling \textendash{} has assumptions regarding conversion factors that, if violated, can induce substantial bias in abundance estimates. Specifically, for sign (e.g. nests, dung) surveys, a single number representing total time for decay is used as a multiplier to convert estimated sign density into animal density. This multiplier is likely inaccurate if not derived from a study reflecting the spatiotemporal variation in decay times. Using dung decay observations from three protected areas in Gabon, and a previous study in Nouabal\'e-Ndoki National Park (Congo), we developed Weibull survival models to adaptively predict forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) dung decay based on environmental variables from field collected and remotely sensed data. Seasonal decay models based on remotely sensed covariates explained 86\% of the variation for the wet season and 79\% for the dry season. These models included canopy cover, cloud cover, humidity, vegetation complexity and slope as factors influencing dung decay. With these models, we assessed sensitivity of elephant density estimates to spatiotemporal environmental heterogeneity, showing that our methods work best for large-scale studies {$>$}50 km2. We simulated decay studies with and without these variables in four Gabonese national parks and reanalyzed two previous surveys of elephants in Mink\'eb\'e National Park, Gabon. Disregarding spatial and temporal variation in decay rate biased population estimates up to 1.6 and 6.9 times. Our reassessment of surveys in Mink\'eb\'e National Park showed an expected loss of 78\% of forest elephants over ten years, but the elephant abundance was 222\% higher than previously estimated. Our models incorporate field or remotely sensed variables to provide an ecological context essential for accurate population estimates while reducing need for expensive decay field studies.},

  abstract  = {Generating trend and population estimates from bird count data is challenging and a variety of factors have to be taken into account. We present an integrative statistical approach for estimating population numbers and trends for seabirds at sea. The method allows for the integration of bird-count data from different sources and sampling schemes: offshore observer-based line transect and digital strip transect surveys and land-based point counts; the estimation of log-linear and highly nonlinear trends; the prediction of population numbers for predefined sub-areas, years, or seasons; and investigations of the effects of various environmental and detection-related covariates on bird count numbers. We applied the approach to count data for great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus) in the German part of the North Sea and Baltic Sea from 1990\textendash 2016. Count data were collected by observer-based offshore ship and aerial surveys, offshore digital aerial surveys, and point counts from the shore. The detectability of great black-backed gulls was affected by the sea state (the condition of the sea surface, characterized by wave height, wave form, foam, and spray) and survey method. Digital and observer-based aerial surveys detected only 59\textendash 77\% of the abundance recorded by ship-based surveys. Great black-backed gulls are mainly present in German waters in winter, when they account for 3\textendash 4\% of the European population. Their core distributional areas are mainly in deeper offshore waters where they are relatively dispersed, with several concentrations probably connected to fishing activity. Great black-backed gulls have undergone substantial declines, with the most pronounced decreases of {$>$}90\% in the offshore waters of the German part of the North Sea. Breeding numbers at important European breeding sites do not show similar declines, suggesting that the trends observed in the sea areas might indicate a shift in the distribution or habitat use and a decreasing importance of marine areas for European great black-backed gulls. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Authors.

  abstract    = {Abstract Studies of habitat selection by higher trophic level species are necessary for using top predator species as indicators of ecosystem functioning. However, contrary to terrestrial ecosystems, few habitat selection studies have been conducted at a fine scale for coastal marine top predator species, and fewer have coupled diet data with habitat selection modeling to highlight a link between prey selection and habitat use. The aim of this study was to characterize spatially and oceanographically, at a fine scale, the habitats used by the European Shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis in the Special Protection Area (SPA) of Houat-H\AA ``dic in the Mor Braz Bay during its foraging activity. Habitat selection models were built using in situ observation data of foraging shags (transect sampling) and spatially explicit environmental data to characterize marine benthic habitats. Observations were first adjusted for detectability biases and shag abundance was subsequently spatialized. The influence of habitat variables on shag abundance was tested using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Diet data were finally confronted to habitat selection models. Results showed that European shags breeding in the Mor Braz Bay changed foraging habitats according to the season and to the different environmental and energetic constraints. The proportion of the main preys also varied seasonally. Rocky and coarse sand habitats were clearly preferred compared to fine or muddy sand habitats. Shags appeared to be more selective in their foraging habitats during the breeding period and the rearing of chicks, using essentially rocky areas close to the colony and consuming preferentially fish from the Labridae family and three other fish families in lower proportions. During the post-breeding period shags used a broader range of habitats and mainly consumed Gadidae. Thus, European shags seem to adjust their feeding strategy to minimize energetic costs, to avoid intra-specific competition and to maximize access to suitable habitats and preys.},

In the second year (from August 1996 to July 1997) two additional habitats viz. 4 and 8 years old oil palm plantation at Sungai, Sedu Estate were selected. Red Junglefowl density was estimated by Distance Sampling Method. Habitat condition was also assessed to determine factors that affected the population size. The densities in 4 years, 8 years and 22 years old oil palm, rubber plantations and orchard were 84.22 km-2, 27.80 km-2, 21.43 km-2, 15.66 km-2 and 6.06 km-2 respectively. The average group size was two birds per group. The largest group comprised of 10 birds was observed in an 8 years old palm oil plantation. The height of the canopy cover was found to have a significant effect on the density of Red Junglefowl. Low canopy cover provides the Red Junglefowl protection against predators and suitable roosting sites.},

  abstract  = {Developing and validating methods to determine trends in populations of threatened species is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation interventions. For cryptic species inhabiting remote environments, this can be particularly challenging. Rock wrens, Xenicus gilviventris, are small passerines endemic to the alpine zone of southern New Zealand. They are highly vulnerable to predation by introduced mammalian predators. Establishing a robust, cost-effective monitoring tool to evaluate population trends in rock wrens is a priority for conservation of both the species and, more broadly, as part of a suite of indicators for evaluating effectiveness of management in New Zealand's alpine ecosystems. We assessed the relative accuracy and precision of three population estimation techniques (mark-resight, distance sampling and simple counts on line transects) for two populations of rock wrens in the Southern Alps over six breeding seasons (2012\textendash 2018). The performance of these population estimators was compared to known rock wren population size derived from simultaneous territory mapping. Indices of abundance derived from counts on transects were correlated with territory mapping at both study areas, and performed better than either mark-resight methods or distance sampling. Simple counts on standardised line transects are a highly cost-effective method of monitoring birds because they do not require banding a population. As such, we recommend that line transect counts using the design outlined in this paper be adopted as a standard method for long-term monitoring of rock wren populations. Although species-specific testing is required to validate use of low-cost population indices, our results may have utility for the monitoring of other cryptic passerines in relatively open habitats.},

  abstract    = {Chimpanzee \emph{(Pan troglodytes troglodytes)} and western gorilla \emph{(Gorilla gorilla gorilla)} populations in central Africa are rapidly declining as a result of disease epidemics, commercial bushmeat hunting, and habitat destruction. Our main objective was to estimate the absolute abundance and habitat utilization of chimpanzees and gorillas in the intact forests of the Goualougo Triangle in the Republic of Congo, and in an adjacent area in which selective logging will take place in the near future. The estimates provide a unique baseline for apes inhabiting an undisturbed environment. A second objective was to compare estimates of abundance and patterns of habitat utilization generated by different techniques: 1) distance sampling of individual ape nests and nest sites along line transects, 2) direct observations of apes during reconnaissance surveys, and 3) observations of ape traces during reconnaissance surveys. We completed a total of 222 km of line transect surveys in 4 sampling areas, resulting in overall density estimates of 1.53 chimpanzees/km2 and 2.34 gorillas/km2 from nest sites. We generated a density estimate of 2.23 chimpanzees/km2 from direct observations during reconnaissance surveys of a semihabituated community in 1 of the 4 sampling areas. Habitat use profiles that nest surveys depicted on transects differed from those of direct observations and traces we encountered on reconnaissance surveys. We found the highest overall abundance of chimpanzee nests in monodominant Gilbertiodendron forest, whereas our direct observations showed that chimpanzees preferred mixed species forest. Transects that traversed the core area of the community range had the highest encounter rates of chimpanzee nests and nest sites. Gorilla nests on transects showed a preference only for mixed species forest with an open canopy, but direct observations and traces on reconnaissance surveys clearly indicated that gorillas use several habitat types. We conclude by evaluating the precision of these nest surveys and our ability to detect future trends in ape densities in the Goualougo Triangle. \textcopyright{} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

Lilian\^a\texteuro\texttrademark s Lovebird Agapornis lilianae is a near-threatened small parrot found in mopane Colophospermum mopane woodland. Its population has not been investigated in any part of its range. We investigated the abundance and density of the Lilian\^a\texteuro\texttrademark s Lovebird in Liwonde National Park, Malawi. Both distance sampling (line and point transects) methods and total counts (waterhole and flyway counts) were applied. The point count method gave very low numbers and was discontinued after the first year. Line transects conducted during the wet season had the highest density estimates of 17 \^A{$\pm$} 4.8 lovebirds km\^a\textasciicircum '2 of mopane woodland. However, number of observations per transect in each year were low. Waterhole counts had the lowest density estimates (10 \^A{$\pm$} 3.5 lovebirds km\^a\textasciicircum '2). Flyway counts gave an intermediate estimate (13 \^A{$\pm$} 3.0 lovebirds km\^a\textasciicircum '2). The total population of Lilian\^a\texteuro\texttrademark s Lovebirds in Liwonde National Park is therefore estimated to be about 4 000 individuals. The use of line transect counts at the end of the rainy season is recommended for continued monitoring of Lilian\^a\texteuro\texttrademark s Lovebirds abundance in Liwonde National Park.},

  abstract   = {In cities, species have to endure severe biotic and abiotic changes in their surroundings, along with various anthropogenic pressures. In recent years, urban dwellers have declined throughout the world, including the most successful urban adapters- House Sparrow and Tree Sparrow. We studied how the population and habitat use of sparrows varied at different urban habitats (city outskirts, followed by residential and highly crowded commercial zones) of Guwahati, India. We carried out point counts using distance sampling to estimate the density of sparrows. We found that sparrows were largely associated with complex urban structures, and the density of sparrows significantly differed between species amongst the habitat. House Sparrow density was three-fold of Tree Sparrow, and the occurrence of both the species was highest at mid-level of urbanization. Tree sparrow had low density compared to House Sparrow in areas where urbanization peaked. Unlike Tree Sparrow, the habitat-specific detection for House Sparrow did not vary significantly. The detectability of Tree Sparrow was higher in residential buildings. The Manly Selectivity ratio for the preference and avoidance of different habitats showed that House Sparrows occupied commercial areas and a combination of commercial-residential sectors more than available and avoided areas with a low level of urbanization (city outskirts). Tree sparrows significantly preferred human habitation dominated by residential houses. We estimated around four hundred thousand sparrows (House Sparrow: 253,615-357,454; Tree Sparrow: 32,882-163,533) in Guwahati. The present study creates a baseline information for the sparrow population and habitat use in Guwahati City, and provides emphasis for maintaining (mid-level urbanized) areas where both the species are abundant.},

Between 1993 and 1997, 74-164 individually known female deer living on Fire Island, New York, USA, were treated remotely with an initial shot of 65 microg porcine zona pellucida (PZP) in Freund's complete adjuvant followed by booster injections of 65 microg PZP in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Starting in 1996, progressively increasing numbers of deer were treated with vaccinating/marking darts. Estimates of population density and composition, using distance sampling methods, began in 1995 in selected portions of the study area. Between 1993 and 1997, fawning rates among individually known, treated adult females decreased by 78.9\% from pretreatment rates. Population density in the most heavily treated area increased by 11\% per year from 1995 to March 1998 and then decreased at 23\% per year to October 2000. In 1999-2000 surveys, fawns comprised 13-14\% of the total population in the most heavily treated area, versus 16-33\% in nearby untreated areas. These results show that PZP can be delivered effectively to sufficient deer to affect population density and composition in some environments, but that technical and logistical improvements are needed before contraception can be used widely to manage suburban deer populations.},

We compared density estimates derived from these techniques to those derived from labour-intensive capture-recapture techniques. Distance sampling and capture-recapture techniques produced comparable density estimates at medium and low hare densities. Density estimates derived from distance sampling were higher than those derived from capture-recapture in high-density hare populations. Both distance sampling and capture-recapture techniques gave wide confidence intervals at high hare density. Histograms of perpendicular sighting distances showed that a large proportion of hares were seen on or close to the transect line and that there was a rapid fall off in detection rates with distance. This finding indicated that hare behaviour may lead to problematic survey design and may reduce the precision of density estimates. The collection of accurate distance sampling data was particularly problematic when hare density was high. In contrast, in low-density hare populations, considerable sampling effort was required to obtain sufficient sightings of hares to reliably estimate density. Dung plots provided a relative index of abundance that successfully ranked populations of mountain hares in order of increasing density as determined by distance sampling and capture-recapture techniques. With careful study design, distance sampling provides a good compromise between accuracy, precision and effort in estimating the density of mountain hares. The use of dung plots is a rapid alternative when only estimates of relative abundance are required.},

  abstract    = {Capsule: The BBS has potential for producing better estimates of habitat-specific densities and population sizes for many UK bird populations than those available previously. Aims: To examine the use of the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) in providing unbiased national population and habitat-specific density estimates of British birds. Methods: Line transect data collected by volunteers in 1998 from 2287 1-km squares across the UK were analysed using distance sampling methods to calculate habitat-specific density and abundance estimates. For each species, the habitat-specific decline in detectability with distance from a transect line was modelled and applied at a regional level to incorporate variation in sampling intensity in different areas of the country. Results: National population and density estimates calculated here were at a magnitude expected for at least seven species in this study. However, national population size estimates were higher than expected for Starling \emph{Sturnus vulgaris}, House Sparrow \emph{Passer domesticus}, Blackbird \emph{Turdus merula}, Greenfinch \emph{Carduelis chloris}, Jackdaw \emph{Corvus monedula}, Whitethroat \emph{Sylvia communis}, Woodpigeon \emph{Columba palumbus} and Linnet \emph{Carduelis cannabina} and lower than expected for Skylark \emph{Alauda arvensis}, Dunnock \emph{Prunella modularis}, Song Thrush \emph{Turdus philomelos} and Corn Bunting \emph{Miliaria calandra}. These differences are likely to be related to differences in sampling design and survey methods. For example, Starling, House Sparrow, Blackbird, Jackdaw, Greenfinch and Wood Pigeon, which have considerable populations in urban areas, were undoubtedly underestimated by the Common Birds Census (CBC). The counts of species that flock during the breeding season, or are not strongly territorial (e.g. Linnet, Jackdaw and Wood Pigeon) could be biased if detectability is strongly related to flock size. National population estimates of Skylark and Corn Bunting are lower than those based on CBC, but higher, or similar, to targeted national surveys of these species. Possible reasons for the differences between these estimates are considered. Conclusions: This study highlights the strength of the BBS over previous data sources in producing national estimates of density and abundance at the habitat and national level. More research on the sex ratio and status of birds counted during surveys, and on the reliability of the detectability functions derived from distance sampling is needed to improve the interpretation of population estimates derived from BBS data. \textcopyright{} 2005 British Trust for Ornithology.},

  abstract  = {Long-term monitoring of biodiversity in protected areas (PAs) is critical to assess threats, link conservation action to species outcomes, and facilitate improved management. Yet, rigorous longitudinal monitoring within PAs is rare. In Southeast Asia (SEA), there is a paucity of long-term wildlife monitoring within PAs, and many threatened species lack population estimates from anywhere in their range, making global assessments difficult. Here, we present new abundance estimates and population trends for 11 species between 2010 and 2020, and spatial distributions for 7 species, based on long-term line transect distance sampling surveys in Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary in Cambodia. These represent the first robust population estimates for four threatened species from anywhere in their range and are among the first long-term wildlife population trend analyses from the entire SEA region. Our study revealed that arboreal primates and green peafowl (Pavo muticus) generally had either stable or increasing population trends, whereas ungulates and semiarboreal primates generally had declining trends. These results suggest that ground-based threats, such as snares and domestic dogs, are having serious negative effects on terrestrial species. These findings have important conservation implications for PAs across SEA that face similar threats yet lack reliable monitoring data.},

  abstract  = {Climate change is affecting species distributions in space and time. In the Gulf of Maine, one of the fastest-warming marine regions on Earth, rapid warming has caused prey-related changes in the distribution of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Concurrently, right whales have returned to historically important areas such as southern New England shelf waters, an area known to have been a whaling ground. We compared aerial survey data from two time periods (2013\textendash 2015; 2017\textendash 2019) to assess trends in right whale abundance in the region during winter and spring. Using distance sampling techniques, we chose a hazard rate key function to model right whale detections and used seasonal encounter rates to estimate abundance. The mean log of abundance increased by 1.40 annually between 2013 and 2019 (p\,=\,0.004), and the mean number of individuals detected per year increased by 2.23 annually between 2013 and 2019 (R2\,=\,0.69, p\,=\,0.001). These results demonstrate the current importance of this habitat and suggest that management options must continually evolve as right whales repatriate historical habitats and potentially expand to new habitats as they adapt to climate change.},

  abstract = {Various methods for estimating animal density from visual data, including distance sampling (DS) and spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR), have recently been adapted for estimating call density using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data, e.g., recordings of animal calls. Here we summarize three methods available for passive acoustic density estimation: plot sampling, DS, and SECR. The first two require distances from the sensors to calling animals (which are obtained by triangulating calls matched among sensors), but SECR only requires matching (not localizing) calls among sensors. We compare via simulation what biases can arise when assumptions underlying these methods are violated. We use insights gleaned from the simulation to compare the performance of the methods when applied to a case study: bowhead whale call data collected from arrays of directional acoustic sensors at five sites in the Beaufort Sea during the fall migration 2007\textendash 2014. Call detections were manually extracted from the recordings by human observers simultaneously scanning spectrograms of recordings from a given site. The large discrepancies between estimates derived using SECR and the other two methods were likely caused primarily by the manual detection procedure leading to non-independent detections among sensors, while errors in estimated distances between detected calls and sensors also contributed to the observed patterns. Our study is among the first to provide a direct comparison of the three methods applied to PAM data and highlights the importance that all assumptions of an analysis method need to be met for correct inference.},

  abstract    = {The overlap of large carnivores, livestock and people can engender conflicts that often threaten the future viability of carnivore populations in the pastoral systems of Africa. A playback survey of lions Panthera leo, spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta and black-backed jackals Canis mesomelas and a transect count of wild herbivores was conducted in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and adjoining pastoral ranches to assess the effect of pastoralism and protection on the density and distribution of carnivores in June 2003. Reliability of the prey counts depended on an assumption of similar observability between the protected and pastoral areas, which we assessed using distance sampling in November 2003 and computer simulations and determined to be similar. Estimates of wild prey biomass density was 2.6 times higher in the ranches (14212 kg/km2) than in the reserve (5472 kg/km2) during this wet season count. Apparent hyena density estimates were 1.3 times higher in the ranches (0.561 hyenas/km2) than in the reserve (0.404 hyenas/km 2), in correspondence with the regional pattern of prey density. This distribution of hyenas is biased towards the reserve, if it is dependent on prey density. Estimates of apparent jackal density were similar in both areas whereas lion density was anomalously 8.0 times lower in the ranches (0.046 lions/km2) than in the reserve (0.369 lions/km2). Lion and hyena densities and prey biomass did not differ between June 1991 (5172.273 kg/km2) and June 2003 (5472 kg/km2) in the reserve, but jackal density increased in the same period. Lions never responded to playbacks in the ranches, so the potential shift in lion behavioural response for different land use zones is another potential explanation for the patterns found here. We think a real shift in lion populations is a better explanation than a behavioural change in relation to playbacks based on additional data from independent systematic and intensive censuses and playback surveys conducted in the ranches. Lion populations in the pastoral ranches seemed headed for extinction, probably owing to conflicts with pastoralism, necessitating urgent conservation interventions that integrate pastoral economic welfare with large carnivore conservation goals to foster long-term viability of lion populations in the pastoral systems. \textcopyright{} 2005 The Zoological Society of London.},

Acoustic encounters of whales producing pulsed A and tonal B call sequences (song; 0.65 animals/h, CV = 0.06) varied by Julian day, survey mode (transit or stationary), and subregion, and encounters of whales producing downswept (D) calls (0.41 animals/h, CV=0.09) varied by Julian day and the number of animals seen. Inclusion of Julian day in all models reflects the seasonal occurrence of blue whales off southern California; however, the seasonal peak in visual encounters and acoustic encounters of D calling whales (July\textendash August) was offset from the peak in acoustic encounters of singing whales (August\textendash September). The relationship between visual and acoustic encounter rates varied regionally, with significant differences in several northern regions. The number of whales heard D calling was positively related to the number of animals seen, whereas the number of singing whales was not related to visual encounter rate.},

The first large scale survey was carried out 1986, following the cessation of legal hunting of the species, to provide a baseline for future monitoring of population changes. The current study therefore aims to (1) compare population size with those of 1986 and (2) employ distance sampling methods (not used in 1986) to obtain estimates of population density and size. Eighteen transects (13 repeated from the 1986 survey and five new) were conducted in the four main areas of laurel forest. Pigeon numbers had increased on nearly all transects but some of the highest increases, proportionately and often numerically, were in areas with lower numbers in 1986. We estimate the current population to be 10,400 individuals, a considerable increase since 1986, probably due to a ban on hunting. As laurel forest habitat is now very well protected the Madeira Laurel Pigeon is relatively safe from extinction.},

Its actual population size, however, is still disputed, and we therefore estimated its numbers in an 80,000 km2 area in the eastern steppe of Mongolia by driving long-distance (1,200-1,400 km) transect surveys during spring and autumn 2000-2002. Quantitative estimates of gazelle numbers are essential for understanding the causes of changes in the population, and thus devising conservation strategies to assure its long-term viability. Observed herds ranged in size from 1-4,000; among surveys, median herd sizes varied from 14-42. Density estimates varied from 10.7 gazelles km-2 in spring to 11.5 gazelles km-2 in autumn, with total population estimates of 803,820 (483,790-1,330,100 95\% confidence interval) and 870,625 (499,432-1,491,278 95\% confidence interval), respectively. Confidence limits were wide, and to obtain a coefficient of variation of 20\%, transect lengths would need to be extended three- to four-fold. Until more efficient means for conducting population surveys can be implemented, driving long-distance transects, combined with distance analysis, seem to provide the best quantitative estimate of Mongolian gazelle populations. \textcopyright{} 2005 FFI.},

  abstract    = {Quantitative data are essential for many aspects of ecological research. Several methods exist to quantify odonate abundance, but complications may arise when abundances in different habitats need to be compared. In this study, I explored a technique that can overcome the variable detectability of odonates in habitats with different visibility. Distance sampling is briefly introduced and the main assumptions are listed. I conducted line transect surveys using distance sampling protocol over several weeks in a rainforest locality in Papua New Guinea to assess the usefulness of distance sampling. The results suggested that estimates of encounter rate and density of odonates are substantially higher when distance sampling is employed. Density in habitats with poor visibility, like the forest interior, is severely underestimated by traditional sampling methods, and this can lead to a misclassification of habitats. Distance sampling is a very useful technique for quantitative odonate sampling, but the sampling effort required for precise estimates is very high. For the rainforest locality in this study at least 15 months of intensive sampling would be required. Further limitations of distance sampling are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Throughout the Himalaya, mountain ungulates are threatened by hunting for meat and body parts, habitat loss, and competition with livestock. Accurate population estimates are important for conservation management but most of the available methods to estimate ungulate densities are difficult to implement in mountainous terrain. Here, we tested the efficacy of the recent extension of the point transect method, using camera traps for estimating density of two mountain ungulates: the group-living Himalayan blue sheep or bharal Pseudois nayaur and the solitary Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster. We deployed camera traps in 2017\textendash 2018 for the bharal (summer: 21 locations; winter: 25) in the trans-Himalayan region (3,000\textendash 5,000 m) and in 2018\textendash 2019 for the musk deer (summer: 30 locations; winter: 28) in subalpine habitats (2,500\textendash 3,500 m) in the Upper Bhagirathi basin, Uttarakhand, India. Using distance sampling with camera traps, we estimated the bharal population to be 0.51 {$\pm$} SE 0.1 individuals/km2 (CV = 0.31) in summer and 0.64 {$\pm$} SE 0.2 individuals/km2 (CV = 0.37) in winter. For musk deer, the estimated density was 0.4 {$\pm$} SE 0.1 individuals/km2 (CV = 0.34) in summer and 0.1 {$\pm$} SE 0.05 individuals/km2 (CV = 0.48) in winter. The high variability in these estimates is probably a result of the topography of the landscape and the biology of the species. We discuss the potential application of distance sampling with camera traps to estimate the density of mountain ungulates in remote and rugged terrain, and the limitations of this method.},

The whole Iberian population numbers nearly 50 000, distributed in more than 50 nuclei, and has generally increased during the last decades. Nevertheless, within this wider context, different conditions apply to different populations, including recent extinction (the Pyrenean population), recovery from recent severe epizooty of sarcoptic mange (e.g. the Sierras de Cazorla and Segura y Las Villas range population) and populations at high densities (e.g. Gredos mountain range and Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park, among others). The main factors affecting the conservation of this species are also reported and discussed. On the basis of current information we propose the status of 'vulnerable' for the Spanish Ibex.},

  abstract    = {Accurate assesment of the populations of mountain ungulates is difficult. Topography and behaviour of animals are important factors influencing detectability, on which direct methods are based. Sympathry with other wild and domestic ungulates increases error of dung identification. Other factors, such as the size of the area to be surveyed, or unmarked populations of the target species, suggests the choice of curvilinear transects. If the basic assumptions of Distance Sampling methodology are met, then estimates of population density and accuracy can be obtained. Current technology (GPS, laser rangefinders, and G.I.S.) can be used to achieve accurate measurements of distances and angles. A crucial problem is to estimate the effective area sampled around each travelling path. Therefore, researchers and managers of mountain ungulates need an adaptation of Distance Sampling methodology to account for a tridimensional scenario imposed by the slope of mountains. There is also a requirement to standardize protocols for collecting data. Alternatives for design surveys and collection data when working with populations of mountain ungulates are discussed.},

  abstract    = {Abstract In the southern North Sea, harbour porpoise occurrence increased in recent years after a phase of low abundances during earlier decades. Only very few studies on porpoise presence in the southern German North Sea exist so far. As anthropogenic activities will strongly increase in this part of the North Sea during the next years it is most important to assess population level effects. This study focuses on the analysis of temporal and spatial trends in porpoise density in this area of recent change. Dedicated aerial line-transect distance sampling surveys were conducted in the southern German North Sea between May 2002 and June 2013 to assess porpoise density and distribution. Statistical inferences on porpoise population trends were made using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. Two approaches were chosen to test for a trend in porpoise density and an additional model focused on the change in density of calves. During 55,820 km of survey effort 4377 porpoises including 140 calves were recorded. A significant effect of increasing spatial aggregation from the lower density areas in the south-eastern German Bight to hot spot areas in the western parts was detected. For the western part of the study area a significant increase in porpoise density between 2002 and 2013 was detected. Seasons were significantly different with highest porpoise density in spring and successively decreasing densities in summer and autumn. From 2008 onwards high densities were also observed in summer. Calf density increased during the study period and was significantly higher in the west. On the basis of this extensive and unique data set on porpoise occurrence in the southern German North Sea the findings clearly show that especially the south-western German North Sea serves as habitat of increasing importance for porpoises throughout the last decade. Definite reasons still remain unresolved. Changes in prey abundance or less favourable conditions in other areas could be important factors, which may also have caused a southward shift from high density areas in northern waters. On this baseline, further integrative approaches might lead to a sound understanding of the effect of anthropogenic activities on the future development of porpoise populations.},

Proposed listing of the Mountain Plover \emph{(Charadrius montanus)} as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1999 was found unwarranted in 2003, but this species remains of special concern to management agencies and conservation groups. Whereas large concentrations of breeding Mountain Plovers occur in Montana and Colorado, estimates of the numbers of Mountain Plovers in Wyoming have ranged from only 500 to 1,500 individuals and are based largely on conjecture. In 2002, we visited all known breeding locales in the state to define areas of concentrated sightings in the Laramie, Shirley, Washakie, Great Divide, and Big Horn basins. In 2003, we used distance sampling to estimate breeding bird densities in these five areas. We pooled these estimates and applied the resulting density to a minimum occupied range for the Mountain Plover based on the documented sightings and a previously derived home-range size of 56.6 ha {$\pm$} 21.5 (SD) to generate a minimum population estimate for the state. Average Mountain Plover density was 4.47 {$\pm$} 0.55 (SE) birds/km2. We calculated a minimum population estimate of 3,393 birds for Wyoming. The Mountain Plover population breeding in Wyoming appears to contribute substantially to a revised continental population estimate of 11,000 to 14,000 birds. Our approach may have applications to quantifying minimum population status of other uncommon species or species of special conservation concern using current database records, such as those compiled in Natural Heritage Programs at the state level.},

We tested whether local-scale resources (host and nectar plants, canopy cover) or landscape context, measured at two scales, better explained the densities of four butterfly species. The density of Coenonympha tullia, which has host plants strongly associated with grassland habitats, was positively correlated with the amount of grassland in 0.5- and 1-km radius landscapes and only occurred in forests when they bordered grasslands. For the other species, Celastrina ladon, Cupido amyntula, and Vanessa cardui, local-scale resources better explained butterfly densities, emphasizing the importance of local habitat quality for butterflies. These three species also used host plants that were distributed more heterogeneously within and among habitat types. Our findings demonstrate the importance of host plant spatial distributions when determining the scale at which butterfly density relates to resources, and we recommend that both these distributions and landscape context be evaluated when developing butterfly monitoring programs, managing for species of concern, or modeling potential habitat},

  abstract    = {Loss and alteration of breeding habitat have been proposed as causes of declines in several Neotropical migrant bird populations. We conducted a 4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia. We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry, and mist netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25); wood thrush density ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10 ha. No radiomarked male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly survival was 0.981 \^A{$\pm$} 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 \^A{$\pm$} 0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579 (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult survival. Annual population growth (\^I\guillemotright ) at PNWR was 1.00 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95\% CI before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment \^I\guillemotright{} declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92). We found no evidence that the current management regime at PNWR, designed to improve red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat, negatively affected wood thrushes.},

  abstract    = {The theory underlying line transect and variable circular plot surveys-distance sampling-begins with an assumed detectability function, giving the probabilities of detecting animals at different distances from the observer's path. The nature of these probabilities is unspecified in the general development, leaving users to question whether the actual probability structure matters. In particular, may one use the methodology in surveys where animals at the same distance have different probabilities of detection? This paper presents three examples where probabilities come from different assumptions: from the random placement of transects; from the uniform distribution of animals over the study region; and from cues randomly detected by the observer. These exemplify situations where detectability may not be a function of distance alone. Horvitz-Thompson estimators are displayed which can be used in each example, but some estimators require measuring features other than distance. A result concerning optimally weighted Horvitz-Thompson estimators shows that all three can be brought under the same umbrella if detection areas are measured instead of detection distances and if animals are uniformly distributed. \textcopyright{} 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

  abstract    = {This paper presents a set of standard extraction parameters and protocols for the use of image analysis techniques in the processing of echo sounder data. The paper includes parameters at the school, elementary distance sampling unit (EDSU) and regional levels. The school level parameters, which are mainly derived from the image analysis, fall into four main categories: positional, morphometric, energetic and environmental. At the sampling unit level (i.e. standard integration units, commonly 1 or 2.5 nautical miles), parameters used include: school structures, protocols for including layers and general scatter plus ancillary (e.g. environmental) variables. These variables are derived mostly from visual examination of the echogram and from ancillary data collected underway. Regional level parameters include those mapped from point samples (e.g. trawls) or which are available as maps. Each school thus has its own unique parameters and is associated with an EDSU and through that to regional data. We discuss the application of such databases to the analysis of echo surveys at a school level in relation to aggregation patterns (school, school cluster and population) and to changes in those aggregation patterns with stock biomass and exploitation pattern.

We investigated avian communities across an urban gradient in Pretoria (South Africa). We defined three urbanization zones: urban, suburban and semi-natural, based on land-cover. We conducted point counts of all species at each of 13 sites in these zones over a 4-month period. We found significantly more species in the semi-natural zone than the urban zone but abundance was significantly lower in semi-natural than urban. The increase in abundance was mainly as a result of alien species with the three most abundant species in the urban zone being all alien. Semi-natural contained fewer alien species than urban and significantly fewer than suburban. The Common Myna Acridotheres tristis was the only alien species that was observed in all three urbanization zones and was the second most abundant species in the suburban and urban zones. Our study supports the process of biotic homogenization, where an increase in alien species occurs in the urban compared to semi-natural zone. Although the suburban zone made an important contribution towards native bird abundance in a larger city environment, this environment was also an important environment for alien species, especially for the Common Myna.},

  abstract   = {Intense trapping of the critically endangered Yellow-crested Cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea) for the international pet trade has devastated its populations across Indonesia such that populations of \&gt;100 individuals remain at only a handful of sites. We combined distance sampling with density surface modeling (DSM) to predict local densities and estimate total population size for one of these areas, Komodo Island, part of Komodo National Park (KNP) in Indonesia. We modeled local density based on topography (topographic wetness index) and habitat types (percentage of palm savanna and deciduous monsoon forest). Our population estimate of 1,113 (95\% CI: 587\textendash 2,109) individuals on Komodo Island was considerably larger than previous conservative estimates. Our density surface maps showed cockatoos to be absent over much of the island, but present at high densities in wooded valleys. Coincidence between our DSM and a set of independent cockatoo observations was high (93\%). Standardized annual counts by KNP staff in selected areas of the island showed increases in cockatoo records from \&lt;400 in 2011 to \textasciitilde 650 in 2017. Taken together, our results indicate that KNP, alongside and indeed because of preserving its iconic Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis), is succeeding in protecting a significant population of Indonesia's rarest cockatoo species. To our knowledge this is the first time DSM has been applied to a critically endangered species. Our findings highlight the potential of DSM for locating abundance hotspots, identifying habitat associations, and estimating global population size in a range of threatened taxa, especially if independent datasets can be used to validate model predictions.\textbullet{} Yellow-crested Cockatoos are threatened by extinction due to illegal trapping for the pet trade. Komodo Island in Indonesia supports one of the largest remaining populations. The island is part of Komodo National Park, famous for its Komodo dragons. A 2006 survey indicated cockatoo numbers might have been declining.\textbullet{} In contrast to previous surveys we sampled the whole island instead of focusing on coastal valleys, which are known to harbor the highest cockatoo densities. We used distance sampling and density surface modeling, which allowed us to estimate how many cockatoos remained undetected and to produce a map of predicted cockatoo densities.\textbullet{} We estimate there are between 600 and 2,100 cockatoos on Komodo, most likely \textasciitilde 1,100. Komodo National Park authorities also reported an increase in their annual counts of cockatoos from below 400 in 2011 to around 650 in 2017. Thus, the cockatoo population on Komodo Island is large and stable; Komodo National Park is successfully protecting its cockatoos.},

  abstract    = {Detection of animals during visual surveys is rarely perfect or constant, and failure to account for imperfect detectability affects the accuracy of abundance estimates. Freshwater cetaceans are among the most threatened group of mammals, and visual surveys are a commonly employed method for estimating population size despite concerns over imperfect and unquantified detectability. We used a combined visual-acoustic survey to estimate detectability of Ganges River dolphins (Platanista gangetica gangetica) in four waterways of southern Bangladesh. The combined visual-acoustic survey resulted in consistently higher detectability than a single observer-team visual survey, thereby improving power to detect trends. Visual detectability was particularly low for dolphins close to meanders where these habitat features temporarily block the view of the preceding river surface. This systematic bias in detectability during visual-only surveys may lead researchers to underestimate the importance of heavily meandering river reaches. Although the benefits of acoustic surveys are increasingly recognised for marine cetaceans, they have not been widely used for monitoring abundance of freshwater cetaceans due to perceived costs and technical skill requirements. We show that acoustic surveys are in fact a relatively cost-effective approach for surveying freshwater cetaceans, once it is acknowledged that methods that do not account for imperfect detectability are of limited value for monitoring.},

  abstract    = {The well-known angle count sampling (ACS) has proved to be an efficient sampling technique and has been applied in forest inventories for many decades. However, ACS assumes total visibility of objects; any violation of this assumption leads to a nondetection bias. We present a novel approach, in which the theory of distance sampling is adapted to traditional ACS to correct for the nondetection bias. Two new estimators were developed based on expanding design-based inclusion probabilities by model-based estimates of the detection probabilities. The new estimators were evaluated in a simulation study as well as in a real forest inventory. It is shown that the nondetection bias of the traditional estimator is up to -52.5\%, whereas the new estimators are approximately unbiased.},

Despite its high ecological value, deadwood is not included in the main focus of traditional forest inventories. The sampling designs of these inventories are therefore not optimal for deadwood sampling. However, in recent years, interest in non-timber aspects of forest structure and demand for multipurpose forest inventories has increased. Drawing on the example of a German state forest district inventory, we suggest an efficient integration of point transect and line intersect sampling of deadwood into an existing forest inventory, carried out as two-phase sampling for stratification. Compared with fixed area sampling, efficiency is tremendously increased using point transect sampling for standing deadwood and line intersect sampling for coarse woody debris.},

Traditional sampling techniques, such as Fixed Area Sampling, Angle Count Sampling and Line Intersect Sampling, do not regard this fact and may be inefficient for surveys of DW, because of limited search areas. A sampling technique that should remedy this shortcoming is Point Transect Sampling (Buckland et al. in Introduction to distance sampling: estimating abundance of biological populations. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2001; Advanced distance sampling: estimating abundance of biological populations. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2004), where as a matter of principle, all objects that are sighted from a fixed location are counted. We compare Point Transect Sampling with the other well-established sampling approaches for the estimation of volume, necromass and carbon storage in terms of precision and sampling effort. It is shown that Point Transect Sampling is the superior method for sampling standing DW regarding efficiency, whereas for sampling downed DW, it is clearly outperformed by Line Intersect Sampling.},

Density ranged from 0.061 (SE = 0.013) to 0.085 (SE = 0.018) parrots/ha and population size ranged from 1,600 (SE = 354) to 2,386 (SE = 508) parrots when extrapolated to the 26,154 ha and 28,162 ha covered by surveys on Abaco in May 2002 and 2003, respectively.

Because parrot distribution was clumped, we would need to survey 213-882 points on Abaco and 258-1,659 points on Inagua to obtain a CV of 10-20\% for estimated density. Cluster size and its variability and clumping increased in wintertime, making surveys imprecise and cost-ineffective. Surveys were reasonably precise and cost-effective in springtime, and we recommend conducting them when parrots are pairing and selecting nesting sites. Survey data should be collected yearly as part of an integrated monitoring strategy to estimate density and other key demographic parameters and improve our understanding of the ecological dynamics of these geographically isolated parrot populations at risk of extinction.},

Motivated by the lack of abundance estimates, corrected for detection probability, we conducted distance-sampling surveys inside and outside the Quill National Park each May in 2016-2019. Detection mode was the most important covariate, with others receiving no support from the data. Detectability of available single individuals and clusters of individuals within 60 m of transect centrelines averaged 0.957 {$\pm$} 0.114 standard error for audio detections, 0.434 {$\pm$} 0.052 for visual detections, and 0.693 {$\pm$} 0.064 for detection modes combined. Availability averaged 0.475 {$\pm$} 0.138 and the product of detectability and availability averaged 0.329 {$\pm$} 0.098. Density averaged 1.459 {$\pm$} 0.277 individuals ha-1 and population size averaged 642 {$\pm$} 122 individuals in 440 ha. Density did not differ along and away from forest trails, but was higher inside than outside the park and at elevations within 201-400 m than 100-200 m and 401-600 m. Density declined by 76\% after hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. We suggest that major hurricanes together with free-ranging livestock overgrazing degraded foraging habitats, limited food supply, and caused a population bottleneck. Our methodology can be implemented across the distribution range to assess population status and trends and evaluate the result of management actions at key conservation sites. Bridled Quail-dove populations probably were declining on most islands before the 2017 hurricanes and population status warrants revision.},

  abstract    = {Pesticides caused high mortality of birds in agro-ecosystems of Argentina's Pampas region during 1995-2003. As part of a program to monitor mortality events, we trained observers in distance sampling methods, conducted field trials under simulated conditions to assess the degree to which the critical assumptions of line-transect surveys were met, and estimated the density and number of chicken carcasses randomly placed along fixed transects in corn stubble, corn, alfalfa, wheat, pasture, and forest. The assumption of 100\% detection probability of carcasses at 0 distance was met. We measured cluster size (1-5 carcasses) exactly and measured perpendicular distance from a cluster to transect centerline (0-40 m) with little error (absolute difference between actual and measured distances: x? = 0.14 m, SE = 0.01, n = 121). Cluster detection was not size-biased in corn stubble but was size-biased in corn, alfalfa, wheat, pasture, forest, and all strata combined. Thirteen 3-observer teams performed equally well in field trials regardless of having or not having observers with previous experience conducting transect surveys of bird carcasses in agro-ecosystems. Teams with experienced and inexperienced observers missed clusters near the centerline (defined here as 1.5-5 m for wheat and 5-15 m for other strata) but detected all clusters on the centerline (defined here as 0-1.5 m for wheat and 0-5 m for other strata). Percent relative bias was 0.36\% for corn stubble (n = 39); 5.63\% for the combined data of corn, alfalfa, wheat, pasture, and forest (n = 73); and 0.51\% for all strata (n = 121). Bias estimates were small in relation to standard errors of density estimates, and the density estimator produced 95\% confidence intervals that always included true densities. Predators and scavengers started removing carcasses during the first day of exposure (cumulative survival: x? = 0.69, SE = 0.04, n = 36) and stopped removing them after day 5 (cumulative survival: x? = 0.04, SE = 0.02, n = 5). Carcass removal rate averaged -0.38/day (SE = 0.03). Although line-transect sampling represents a viable method to estimate the density and number of dead birds in agro-ecosystems, scavenging data should be collected to adjust these estimates, even when surveys are conducted the day following pesticide application. An effective communication network between collaborators and the general public and observer readiness are needed as part of research and monitoring efforts to guide decision-making on agricultural practices, promote law enforcement, and manage wildlife in agro-ecosystems.},

  abstract    = {Although investigators have evaluated the efficacy of survey methods for assessing densities of breeding birds, few comparisons have been made of survey methods for wintering birds, especially in grasslands. In winter, social behavior and spatial distributions often differ from those in the breeding season. We evaluated the degree of correspondence between density estimates based on different survey methods. Surveys were conducted during two winters (2001-2002 and 2002-2003) on 16 grassland sites in southwestern Oklahoma. Line-transect (using a detection function to account for birds present but not detected) and area-search (where density was based on the total count within a given area) methods were employed. Observations on line transects were also analyzed as strip transects, where density was based on total count within a given strip width and no detection function was used. Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), LeConte's Sparrows (Ammodramus leconteii), Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia), Smith's Longspurs (Calcarius pictus), Chestnut-collared Longspurs (C. ornatus), and Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were sufficiently abundant to allow comparison. Area-search density estimates tended to be higher than line-transect estimates for Savannah Sparrows, Song Sparrows, and Eastern Meadowlarks, suggesting that some individuals initially located close to the transect line were not detected on line transects. The area-search and line-transect methods gave similar density estimates for Chestnut-collared and Smith's longspurs. Area-search estimates of Eastern Meadowlarks were significantly higher in the second year of the study only. For this species, area-search estimates did not differ from those of strip transects covering an equal area, so the reason for the differing meadowlark estimates is not clear. Higher density estimates using the area-search method likely resulted from: (1) birds that might escape detection by hiding were more likely detected (flushed) during area searches because of the repeated passes through the area, and (2) birds close to the line in line transects escape detection by hiding, biasing those estimates low. We also evaluated the correspondence of density rankings for the six species as determined by the different survey methods and for the same species across survey sites. Correlations among the six species of the area-search results with those of line transects and strip transects generally were high, increasing in 2002-2003 when densities of birds were greater. All three methods provided similar density rankings among species. Density rankings within species across sites for the four non-longspur species generally were concordant for the three methods, suggesting that any of them will adequately reflect among-site differences, especially when densities vary greatly across sites. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which grassland birds are missed on line transects. We suggest that workers using line transects to study these species give careful consideration and make additional efforts to satisfy the distance-sampling assumption that all birds on or near the line are detected. If density is measured as a total count in a fixed area, we recommend that observers pass within \textexclamdown 10 m of all points in the area. \textcopyright 2006 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

Understanding the role of the original mosaic landscapes in wildlife species and the effects of the current changes as pine forest plantations, performed even outside the forest ecological boundaries, are important conservation issues. We studied variation in the density of the endangered spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in three areas that include the four most common land types within the species' range (pine forests, natural shrubs, dryland crop fields, and abandoned crop fields). Tortoise densities were estimated using a two-stage modeling approach with line transect distance sampling. Densities in dryland crop fields, abandoned crop fields and natural shrubs were higher ({$>$}6 individuals/ha) than in pine forests (1.25 individuals/ha). We also found large variation in density in the pine forests. Recent pine plantations showed higher densities than mature pine forests where shrub and herbaceous cover was taller and thicker. We hypothesize that mature pine forest might constrain tortoise activity by acting as partial barriers to movements. This issue is relevant for management purposes given that large areas in the tortoise's range have recently been converted to pine plantations.},

  abstract    = {Counting techniques are widely used to study and monitor terrestrial birds. To assess current applications of counting techniques, we reviewed landbird studies published 1989-1998 in nine major journals and one symposium. Commonly used techniques fell into two groups: Procedures that used counts of bird detections as an index to abundance (index counts), and procedures that used empirical models of detectability to estimate density. Index counts rely upon assumptions concerning detectability that are difficult or impossible to meet in most field studies, but nonetheless remain the technique of choice among ornithologists; 95\% of studies we reviewed relied upon point counts, strip transects, or other index procedures. Detectability-based density estimates were rarely used and deserve wider application in landbird studies. Distance sampling is a comprehensive extension of earlier detectability-based procedures (variable-width transects, variable circular plots) and a viable alternative to index counts. We provide a conceptual overview of distance sampling, specific recommendations for applying this technique to studies of landbirds, and an introduction to analysis of distance sampling data using the program DISTANCE.},

  abstract    = {Conserving large populations with unique adaptations is essential for minimizing extinction risks. Sundarban mangroves (\textquestiondown 10,000 km2) are the only mangrove inhabited by tigers. Baseline information about this tiger population is lacking due to its man-eating reputation and logistic difficulties of sampling. Herein, we adapt photographic capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and distance sampling to estimate tiger and prey densities. We placed baited camera stations in a typical mangrove in 2010 and 2012. We used telemetry based tiger home-range radius (5.73 km, SE 0.72 km) to estimate effective trapping area (ETA). An effort of 407 and 1073 trap nights were exerted to photocapture 10 and 22 unique tigers in 2010 and 2012. We accounted for use of bait by modelling behaviour and heterogeneity effects in program MARK and secr package in program R. Using traditional CMR, tiger number was estimated at 11 (SE 2) and density at 4.07 (SE range 3.09\textendash 5.17) in 2010 while in 2012, tiger number was 24 (SE 3) and density 4.63 (SE range 3.92\textendash 5.40) tigers/100 km2. With likelihood based spatially explicit CMR, tiger densities were estimated at 4.08 (SE 1.51) in 2010 and 5.81 (SE 1.24) tigers/100 km2 in 2012. Using distance sampling along water channels, we estimated chital density at 5.24/km2, SE 1.23 which could potentially support 4.68 tigers/100 km2 [95 \% CI (3.92, 5.57)]. Our estimates suggest that Sundarban tiger population is one of the largest in the world and therefore merits high conservation status.},

  abstract    = {Distance-sampling methods are commonly used in studies of animal populations to estimate population density. A common objective of such studies is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences. However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models. In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates covariate effects on abundance. The model is based on specification of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect data of Ovenbirds \emph{(Seiurus aurocapillus)} collected using a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure (understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management on Ovenbird populations.},

  abstract    = {1. Monitoring red fox \emph{Vulpes vulpes} abundance is necessary to assess the status and management of this species and to understand predator-prey relationships. Spotlight counts are most often used for this purpose. However, comparisons between regions or over years may be questionable when using encounter rates, i.e. the number of foxes seen per kilometre. We evaluated whether distance-sampling methods, which take account of variation in visibility, could be applied to spotlight counts of foxes along roads and trails. 2. Distance-sampling methods were used at 12 contrasting sites in France in a systematic design with equally spaced transects or points. Line and point transects were simultaneously applied at two sites to find the more precise and efficient method. 3. The number of foxes seen near the centreline was always low, although some foxes may have been missed. A peak of sightings at subsequent intervals from the centreline suggested evasive movements. 4. Despite the low sighting frequency near the centreline, which may reflect a violation of distance-sampling assumptions, a good model fit was obtained for eight out of 12 data sets using a regular 50-m grouping of the distance data. Increasing the first interval to account for evasive movement improved model fit in the four other data sets. Density estimates ranged from 0.39 to 3.54 foxes km-2 (range of coefficient of variation 4.5-24.6\%). 5. Point and line transects resulted in similar density estimates, but point transects were more time consuming and resulted in larger coefficients of variation due to a smaller number of foxes seen by this method. Line transects may therefore produce better estimates of fox numbers. 6. There were few differences among the effective strip width estimates between the 12 sites (range 191-286 m), thus line transect estimates may have a limited advantage over encounter rates. 7. Synthesis and applications. The systematic scheme we applied in this study improved sampling design and variance estimations and should be useful for surveying terrestrial mammals with spotlight counts. However, the location of transects along roads and in open habitats probably induced biased results. Methodological improvements are necessary before spotlight distance sampling can become a routine monitoring tool for foxes.},

Concurrently, we estimated densities of 10 goshawk prey species (seven birds, three mammals) using distance sampling. We then assessed the relationship between goshawk productivity (number of fledglings produced) and prey density within and among years by relating the contribution of individual prey species and total prey density to goshawk productivity. We also estimated the proportion of total diet and biomass for each species that contributed ?3\% of all prey items. Total prey density was highly correlated with variation in goshawk productivity (r2 = 0.98, P = 0.012). Red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) density explained more variation in goshawk productivity than any other species (r2 = 0.94, P = 0.031), but density could not be estimated for every predominant prey species in goshawk diets. However, only red squirrels had a positive and significant relationship to goshawk productivity in terms of frequency (r2 = 0.97, P = 0.014) and biomass (r2 = 0.95, P = 0.033). Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) and cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), which contributed the greatest frequency and biomass, respectively, to goshawk diets, showed no relationship with goshawk productivity. Even though goshawks on the Kaibab Plateau have a diverse diet and will readily switch to alternate prey species, goshawk productivity showed significant interannual variation. Our results suggest that the magnitude of goshawk productivity was determined by total prey density and annual variation was driven by differences in the densities of critical prey species. \textcopyright{} 2005 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

Annual game yield estimates varied considerably, depending on the sampling technique used. Estimates were further confounded by the fact that game can move freely between ranches. Our estimates suggest that the number of game that could be harvested per annum over time is relatively small. The spatial separation between cattle and game indicates that combining game and cattle ranching may be economical. Further studies on the space-use patterns for these species are necessary to determine how many ranches share the same animals. Rigorous population estimation techniques using aerial transects, combined with setting threshold values below which the populations will not be harvested, are necessary to reliably assess the density of the animals in this region and to prevent over harvesting.},

  abstract = {Conventional distance sampling approaches rely on the design assumption (i.e. uniform distribution of individuals in relation to transects) to ensure unbiased inference to the population of interest. However, randomized design recommendations are not always followed or may be impractical to implement for some survey types, particularly in cases where transects must be placed perpendicular to the habitat gradient. Full-likelihood spatial distance sampling models provide a potential solution to violations of the design assumption by jointly modelling the detection and occurrence processes using spatially indexed habitat covariates. Through simulation and an applied example based on a survey for Dall's sheep in Alaska, USA, we used a full-likelihood distance sampling approach to investigate the potential for bias in cases where transects placed perpendicular to the habitat gradient (e.g. elevational contours) are non-randomly sampled. We also assessed the utility of spatial approaches in cases where transects are placed along linear features, such as roads or ridgelines, where habitat may be unrepresentative of the overall study area. Our results showed that the full-likelihood approach was generally unbiased, even in extreme scenarios where habitat was inversely related to distance from the transect. For the Dall's sheep example, our results showed that more efficient designs with reduced sampling effort in low-quality habitats are a practical solution for reducing logistical costs when the data are analysed in a spatial modelling framework. Together, our findings confirm and extend existing work suggesting that spatial distance sampling can be a useful solution when non-random designs are employed. Given the high cost of survey implementation in many cases, the development of valid alternatives to design-based inference will aid in the amount of information available for a variety of species. The results of our work will be useful for practitioners in assessing alternative designs relative to particular survey applications.},

  abstract   = {Wildlife population estimators often require formal adjustment for imperfect detection of individuals during surveys. Conventional distance sampling (CDS) and its extensions (mark-recapture distance sampling [MRDS], temporary emigration distance sampling [TEDS]) are popular approaches for producing unbiased estimators of wildlife abundance. However, despite extensive discussion and development of distance sampling theory in the literature, deciding which of these alternatives is most appropriate for a particular scenario can be confusing. Some of this confusion may stem from an incomplete understanding of how each approach addresses the components of the detection process. Here we describe the proper application of CDS, MRDS, and TEDS approaches and use applied examples to help clarify their differing assumptions with respect to the components of the detection process. To further aid the practitioner, we summarize the differences in a decision tree that can be used to identify cases where a more complex alternative (e.g., MRDS or TEDS) may be appropriate for a given survey application. Although the more complex approaches can account for additional sources of bias, in practical applications one also must consider estimator precision. Therefore, we also review the concept of total estimator error in the context of comparing competing methods for a given application to aid in the selection of the most appropriate distance sampling approach. Finally, we detail how the use of more advanced techniques (i.e., informed priors, open-population distance sampling models, and integrated modeling approaches) can further reduce total estimator error by leveraging information from existing and ongoing data collection. By synthesizing the existing literature on CDS, MRDS, TEDS and their extensions, in conjunction with the concepts of total estimator error and the components of the detection process, we provide a comprehensive guide that can be used by the practitioner to more efficiently, effectively, and appropriately apply distance sampling in a variety of settings.},

  abstract   = {Obtaining useful estimates of wildlife abundance or density requires thoughtful attention to potential sources of bias and precision, and it is widely understood that addressing incomplete detection is critical to appropriate inference. When the underlying assumptions of sampling approaches are violated, both increased bias and reduced precision of the population estimator may result. Bear (Ursus spp.) populations can be difficult to sample and are often monitored using mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) methods, although obtaining adequate sample sizes can be cost prohibitive. With the goal of improving inference, we examined the underlying methodological assumptions and estimator efficiency of three datasets collected under an MRDS protocol designed specifically for bears. We analyzed these data using MRDS, conventional distance sampling (CDS), and open-distance sampling approaches to evaluate the apparent bias-precision tradeoff relative to the assumptions inherent under each approach. We also evaluated the incorporation of informative priors on detection parameters within a Bayesian context. We found that the CDS estimator had low apparent bias and was more efficient than the more complex MRDS estimator. When combined with informative priors on the detection process, precision was increased by {$>$}50\% compared to the MRDS approach with little apparent bias. In addition, open-distance sampling models revealed a serious violation of the assumption that all bears were available to be sampled. Inference is directly related to the underlying assumptions of the survey design and the analytical tools employed. We show that for aerial surveys of bears, avoidance of unnecessary model complexity, use of prior information, and the application of open population models can be used to greatly improve estimator performance and simplify field protocols. Although we focused on distance sampling-based aerial surveys for bears, the general concepts we addressed apply to a variety of wildlife survey contexts.},

  abstract = {Roads affect flora and fauna across the world. Large mammals are particularly vulnerable to road effects because their large home ranges lead to a higher probability of contact with road networks. Disturbance associated with roads can alter the probability of habitat use by making suitable habitat near roads inaccessible or underused. Many studies and monitoring programs for large mammals such as guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in South America, however, rely on counts made from roads to estimate population abundance and distribution. These counts implicitly assume that animal responses to roads are negligible, an assumption almost universally unstudied. We used density surface models with aerial survey data to evaluate the effects of unpaved roads on guanaco habitat selection, at the scale of the species' home range, in a Patagonian site with limited poaching. Contrary to expectations and regardless of disturbance level associated with roads, guanacos did not avoid roads at site (0.36 km2) or patch (2.4 km2) scales during any season. We posit two non-exclusive hypotheses to explain our results: (1) disturbance levels of roads are below thresholds of guanaco response, and (2) guanacos in our study area tolerated motorized vehicles due to limited harassment by poachers from roads. Our results, considered with opposite findings of strong road effects on guanaco at a landscape and regional scales, highlight the need to assess whether road surveys lead to biased estimates of ungulate abundance and distribution under different environmental conditions, human activities and scales of interest. Where long-term monitoring of large mammal populations relies on road surveys, aerial or other non-road surveys could be strategically conducted to determine whether counts from roads provide reliable estimates.},

  abstract    = {\textexclamdown p\textquestiondown Monitoring species abundance and distribution is a prerequisite when assessing species status and population viability, a difficult task to achieve for large herbivores at ecologically meaningful scales. Co-occurrence patterns can be used to infer mechanisms of community organization (such as biotic interactions), although it has been traditionally applied to binary presence/absence data. Here, we combine density surface and null models of abundance data as a novel approach to analyze the spatial and seasonal dynamics of abundance and distribution of guanacos (\textexclamdown italic\textquestiondown Lama guanicoe\textexclamdown/italic\textquestiondown ) and domestic herbivores in northern Patagonia, in order to visually and analytically compare the dispersion and co-occurrence pattern of ungulates. We found a marked seasonal pattern in abundance and spatial distribution of \textexclamdown italic\textquestiondown L. guanicoe\textexclamdown/italic\textquestiondown. The guanaco population reached its maximum annual size and spatial dispersion in spring-summer, decreasing up to 6.5 times in size and occupying few sites of the study area in fall-winter. These results are evidence of the seasonal migration process of guanaco populations, an increasingly rare event for terrestrial mammals worldwide. The maximum number of guanacos estimated for spring (25951) is higher than the total population size (10000) 20 years ago, probably due to both counting methodology and population growth. Livestock were mostly distributed near human settlements, as expected by the sedentary management practiced by local people. Herbivore distribution was non-random; i.e., guanaco and livestock abundances co-varied negatively in all seasons, more than expected by chance. Segregation degree of guanaco and small-livestock (goats and sheep) was comparatively stronger than that of guanaco and large-livestock, suggesting a competition mechanism between ecologically similar herbivores, although various environmental factors could also contribute to habitat segregation. The new and compelling combination of methods used here is highly useful for researchers who conduct counts of animals to simultaneously estimate population sizes, distributions, assess temporal trends and characterize multi-species spatial interactions.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown},

  abstract    = {Post-release monitoring, including abundance estimation, is an important part of reintroductions, providing a basis for management intervention designed to achieve long-term persistence. The Arabian oryx \emph{Oryx leucoryx} became extinct in the wild in 1972, surviving as captive populations. Since 1982 reintroductions of Arabian oryx have taken place in Oman and Saudi Arabia. Modelling of oryx population dynamics has highlighted the importance of precise estimation of population size (N). Between 1990 and 2000 three methods of estimating N have been applied in Mahazat as-Sayd protected area in Saudi Arabia: derived population estimates (DPE) based on known births and deaths, distance sampling, and mark-resighting (MR). This study assesses the feasibility and precision of these methods. Inability to assess precision, interdependence of consecutive estimates, and the assumption that all gains and losses are recorded, make DPE of limited value. At current densities, distance sampling along 455 km of driven transects yields too few detections to derive precise estimates of N. To achieve a coefficient of variation of 20\% it would be necessary to drive up to c. 2,900 km of transect; this amount of survey effort could be achieved through pooling of data across repeat surveys of established transects. MR estimates, based on re-sighting of collared oryx, have the potential to yield the most precise estimates of N when the proportion of marked animals reaches 30\% of the total population. The most reliable MR estimates available indicate the Mahazat as-Sayd Arabian oryx population had grown to \textquestiondown 400 animals by 2000. \textcopyright{} 2003 FFI.},

Here, we describe its status and habitat in the Wembere Steppe, Sukumaland, Tanzania, an unprotected area of seasonally inundated grassland bordered partly by Acacia scrub. Although its habitat in the steppe was thought likely to span c. 175 km north-south during the 1960s to 1970s, we found the apalis to be patchily distributed over a distance of only 102 km north-south. Distance sampling yielded a density estimate of c. 7-16 birds km-2; equivalent to c. 3-7 pairs km-2, after juveniles (18\% of the population) were excluded, and assuming that all adults were paired. The species occupied a very narrow foraging niche, feeding almost exclusively in Whistling Thorn \emph{Acacia drepanolobium}, which accounted for 66\% of woody stems in the study area, but for 95\% of stems in the immediate vicinity of apalis sightings. Half of all individuals were encountered in the tallest, densest stands of A. drepanolobium, which covered less than 6\% of the study area. Signs of scrub clearance, pruning and browsing were widespread in the steppe, and may have intensified during 1967-2002, when the human population in surrounding districts increased at a mean rate of c. 2-4\% per year. Further research is required to determine whether our findings are representative of the species in other seasons and at other sites. \textcopyright{} 2006 BirdLife International.},

In common with other montane forest fragments in the EBA, Bwindi's structure and ecology have been substantially modified by human activities, the impact of which on its birds is difficult to gauge in the absence of quantitative information on their habitat use and abundance. During October 1999, habitat associations of nine restricted-range species and of 12 species with which they were commonly associated, were measured at Ruhija, Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between habitat, topography, altitude and species occurrence. Population densities of 19 species were estimated using distance sampling, at survey points visited between dawn and midday. Although the detection rate declined during the morning, observations made towards midday helped to improve precision, without lowering density estimates. Eight habitat and topographical features significantly associated with restricted-range species are described. Few of the features measured were significantly associated with more than one species, underlining the importance of maintaining a diverse forest structure. Two restricted-range species were among the commonest birds in the study area, while a further four species were at least as abundant as their more widespread congeners.},

We focused on A. mangium, Albizia (Paraserianthes falcataria), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), and logged native forest, and compared our results to those of a study conducted at the same plantation in 1982. The number of forest species in the industrial groves did not change dramatically between 1982 and 2005, even though the trees had been cropped several times and the plantation was, by 2005, completely surrounded by cleared land and far removed from primary forest. However, as is common in logged or isolated forests throughout the world, certain primary forest groups (e.g., muscicapine flycatchers) have been extirpated from the entire plantation area. The industrial groves also lacked some larger species of kingfisher, woodpeckers, and canopy frugivores. Nevertheless, numerous primary forest taxa (ca. 50\% of species) were found in mature industrial tree groves. Albizia attracted the most species of birds, followed closely by Acacia. Both tree types underpinned relatively complex secondary forests that attracted forest birds. In contrast, younger groves of Acacia and Albizia held mainly open country and scrub species. Oil palm, as a remarkably simple and unusual habitat, attracted few bird species. Sustained occurrence of forest birds in all groves of exotic trees at Sabah Softwoods was substantially enhanced by the relatively rich avifauna of the logged native forest remaining in substantial stands throughout the plantation.},

  abstract = {Lake St. Clair and western Lake Erie are important migration staging areas for diving ducks including canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria), redheads (Aythya americana), and lesser and greater scaup (Aythya affinis and Aythya marila). Starting in 1983, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) attempted to census diving ducks on the United States portion of Lake St. Clair throughout autumn migration; however, in 2010 the MDNR expanded the traditionally surveyed area to include all of Lake St. Clair and a portion of western Lake Erie. The idea of achieving a census over the expanded study area was unrealistic, and instead distance sampling techniques were adopted in an effort to generate statistically valid estimates of detection probabilities and abundances for diving ducks during spring and autumn migration. We found distance sampling techniques to be a viable option for estimating diving duck abundance as long as flock size is accounted for as a covariate affecting the detection function. Diving ducks were generally more abundant on our study area during autumn migration with a mean of 306,327ducks/survey (SE=40,729) compared to an average spring abundance of 91,053ducks/survey (SE=19,175). Peak abundance occurred on 20 November 2012 with an estimated 596,335 diving ducks on Lake St. Clair and western Lake Erie. Ultimately, our methodology could be used to establish long-term, standardized data collection techniques and applied to conservation planning for waterfowl in the Great Lakes region.},

We found that bird and vegetation communities are currently similar, but retain some differences in species composition. Rank abundance curves for primary and secondary forest bird communities showed very similar patterns of species dominance. Species composition was also similar on the two sites which shared 24 of the 25 most frequently recorded species. Nonetheless, comparisons of density estimates derived from distance sampling showed three bird species were more abundant on primary forest sites and that one bird species was significantly more abundant on secondary forest sites. Notably, comparisons based on raw counts (unadjusted for potential differences in detectability) produced somewhat different results. Analyses of vegetation samples for the paired sites also showed relative similarity, but with some differences between primary and secondary forests. Primary forest sites had more large trees (trees greater than 50 cm diameter at breast height) and late successional species. Primary forest sites had a denser tall shrub layer while secondary forest sites had a denser canopy layer. Nonetheless, tree species richness, basal area of live trees and number of standing snags did not differ between primary and secondary forest sites. Results indicate that breeding bird communities on sites within the park that were logged commercially 70 years ago are currently quite similar to bird communities on sites with no history of human disturbance. Similarities between the bird communities on previously disturbed and undisturbed sites in Great Smoky Mountains National Park may exceed those on more fragmented landscapes because large patches of primary forest, adjacent to commercially logged sites, remained in the park when it was established in 1935. These patches of primary forest may have served as source areas for commercially logged sites.},

  abstract  = {A successful wildlife management requires monitoring. Including non-scientific volunteers into monitoring actions is a common way for obtaining long-term and comprehensive data. Hunters present a valuable target group as they are spread out nationwide in Germany and additionally, they provide a know-how regarding game species. Since 1990s, various German hunting associations established monitoring programs and motivated hunters to join, in order to record population sizes of huntable game species under standardized census methods. The aim of this study was to compare instructed hunters performed spotlight counts of European brown hares with thermography in three federal states (Lower-Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, North Rhine-Westphalia) in 2015\textendash 2018 in Northern Germany. Therefore, we modelled the number of hares counted by both methods with the associated observed area. Moreover, we performed repeated thermographic counts in selected areas and performed distance sampling to test the deviations of estimated population densities within a short time period. Repeated infrared thermographic counts on three consecutive nights show a coefficient of variation from 6.6\% to 15.5\% with deviations of 2.2\textendash 2.7 hares per 100 ha, while the method of distance sampling reveals minor deviations of 0.9\textendash 1.7 hares per 100 ha and a coefficient of variation from 3.1\textendash 7.4\%. The coefficient of variation value between spotlight and infrared thermographic count lies between 0 to 21.4\%. Our model confirmed no significant differences between the European brown hare density estimations based on a spotlight count and an infrared thermographic count on the following night. The results provide insight into the dimension of the error margin of density estimations performed by spotlight counts. Therefore, we recommend to take possible counting errors into account and to ideally perform repeated counts to assess the error margin for each counting site. This would help for example to quantify the uncertainty in the calculation of mortality rates. Additionally, our results show that monitoring data generated by instructed hunters can provide reliable and valid data, if implemented and conducted in a standardized scientific way.},

  abstract    = {1. The need to assess population size and change is central to any population monitoring programme. A range of monitoring techniques is available for deer, but few studies have addressed the performance of these techniques in terms of their accuracy and their power to detect population changes reliably. This study compares the performance of three commonly used techniques to monitor woodland deer populations in terms of their accuracy, precision and statistical power using field data and simulation modelling. 2. Faecal Standing Crop (FSC) was found to provide the most accurate estimates at all deer densities studied, but was outperformed by distance sampling using thermal imaging in terms of precision and statistical power. Faecal Accumulation Rate (FAR) performed worst in terms of precision and statistical power, and was inferior in terms of accuracy to FSC. The accuracy of FAR and distance sampling using thermal imaging was similar. 3. Annual surveying is not the best use of resources, since 10\% per annum increases or decreases in a population could not be detected by any of the techniques within a 3-year time period. Even with the best technique under the most favourable conditions of deer density simulated in this study, a population change could only be detected reliably once the population had increased by 33\% or decreased by 27\%. In the least favourable conditions, the respective figures were a 380\% increase or extinction. 4. All the techniques studied are relatively poor at detecting population change, so their use in practical deer management needs to be treated with caution. The consequences of relying on similar techniques to detect population change for rare species could be severe. \textcopyright{} 2004 Mammal Society, Mammal Review.},

  abstract    = {The underwater television (UWTV) technique for Nephrops stock assessment was evaluated from 7 grounds in the Aegean. Expert analysts made all burrow identification and burrow size measurements. Burrow density was given by (1) real-time in situ counts; (2) post-sampling laboratory replicate counts; and (3) multiple laboratory counts in strips analyzed by DISTANCE sampling in order to account for partial burrows and edge effects leading to over- or underestimation of densities. Trawls were used to estimate densities, mean carapace length and weight per ground. The laboratory method was the most efficient approach. In situ counts resulted in underestimation at high densities and overestimation at low densities. Further work with DISTANCE should include simulations with hypothetical data to optimise band widths related to the expected burrow size. All burrow density estimates produced similar significant negative relationships with burrow size and positive relationships with trawl density. Based on the tow length effects analysis, the use of tow lengths of 500 and 1000 m per station for high and mid-/low-density sites, respectively, is recommended. With expert analysts, laboratory counts, trawl support data, accurate delimitation of the grounds and adequate sampling spread to allow for local stock variability differences, the UWTV technique can be used for fishery-independent stock assessments, and its precision refined by taking into account edge effects.},

  abstract    = {Grassland bird populations are sharply declining in North America. Changes in agricultural practices during the past 50 years have been suggested as one of the major causes of this decline. Field-border conservation practices encouraged by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Conservation Buffer Initiative meet many of the needs of sustainable agriculture and offer excellent opportunities to enhance local grassland bird populations within intensive agricultural production systems. Despite the abundant information on avian use of and reproductive success in, strip habitats during the breeding season, few studies have examined the potential value of field borders for wintering birds. We planted 89.0 km of field borders (6.1 m wide) along agricultural field edges on one-half of each of three row crop and forage production farms in northeastern Mississippi. We sampled bird communities along these field edges during February-March 2002 and 2003 using line-transect distance sampling and strip transects to estimate density and community structure, respectively. We used Program DISTANCE to estimate densities of Song (Melospiza melodia), Savannah (Passerculus sandwichensis), and other sparrows along bordered and non-bordered transects while controlling for adjacent plant community. Greater densities of several sparrow species were observed along most bordered transects. However, effects of field borders differed by species and adjacent plant community types. Diversity, species richness, and relative conservation value (a weighted index derived by multiplying species-specific abundances by their respective Partners in Flight conservation priority scores) were similar between bordered and non-bordered edges. Field borders are practical conservation tools that can be used to accrue multiple environmental benefits and enhance wintering farmland bird populations. Provision of wintering habitat at southern latitudes may influence population trajectories of short-distance migrants of regional conservation concern.},

  abstract    = {We combined Breeding Bird Survey point count protocol and distance sampling to survey spring migrant and breeding birds in Vicksburg National Military Park on 33 days between March and June of 2003 and 2004. For 26 of 106 detected species, we used program DISTANCE to estimate detection probabilities and densities from 660 3-min point counts in which detections were recorded within four distance annuli. For most species, estimates of detection probability, and thereby density estimates, were improved through incorporation of the proportion of forest cover at point count locations as a covariate. Our results suggest Breeding Bird Surveys would benefit from the use of distance sampling and a quantitative characterization of habitat at point count locations. During spring migration, we estimated that the most common migrant species accounted for a population of 5000-9000 birds in Vicksburg National Military Park (636 ha). Species with average populations of \textquestiondown 300 individuals during migration were: Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum), White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus), Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), and Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula). Of 56 species that bred in Vicksburg National Military Park, we estimated that the most common 18 species accounted for \textquestiondown 8150 individuals. The six most abundant breeding species, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, White-eyed Vireo, Summer Tanager (Piranga rubra), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater), accounted for \textquestiondown 5800 individuals. \textcopyright{} The Cooper Ornithological Society 2006.},

  abstract    = {Distance sight-resight sampling has particular relevance to aerial surveys, in which height above ground and aircraft speed make the critical assumption of certain detection on the track-line unrealistic. Recent developments in distance sight-resight theory have left practical issues related to data collection as the major impediment to widespread use of distance sight-resight sampling in aerial surveys. We describe and evaluate a system to automatically log, store, and process data from distance sight-resight aerial surveys. The system has a primary digital system and a secondary audio system. The digital system comprises a sighting "gun" and small keypad for each observer, a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, and an altimeter interface, all linked to a central laptop computer. The gun is used to record time and angle of declination from the horizon of sighted groups of animals as they pass the aircraft. The keypad is used to record information on species and group size. The altimeter interface records altitude from the aircraft's radar altimeter, and the GPS receiver provides location data at user-definable intervals. We wrote software to import data into a database and convert it into a form appropriate for distance sight-resight analyses. Perpendicular distance of sighted groups of animals from the flight path is calculated from altitude and angle of declination. Time, angle of declination, species, and group size of sightings by independent observers on the same side of the aircraft are used as criteria to classify single and duplicate sightings, allowing testing of the critical distance sampling assumption [g(0)=1] and estimation of g(0) if that assumption fails. An audio system comprising headphones for each observer and a 4-track tape recorder allows recording of data that are difficult to accommodate in the digital system and provides a backup to the digital system. We evaluated the system by conducting experimental surveys and reviewing results from actual surveys.},

Bias and precision of density estimation in relation to various levels of these factors were assessed for four types of line-transect estimator (simple parametric, generalised parametric, non-parametric and quasi-strip) using line-transect survey data from macropod populations of known density. Bias was stable across all grouping levels tested for the simple parametric estimator, and stable across all but the coarsest grouping level for the generalized parametric and non-parametric estimators, but varied substantially across the range of levels tested for the quasi-strip estimator. Precision improved as the number of grouping levels increased for all estimators tested, but the extent of improvement varied between estimators, and for the estimator most affected, improvement was marginal beyond intermediate grouping levels. Density estimates were generally more accurate and precise when analysed in ungrouped form than in grouped form. Varying the analytical unit did not affect bias, but precision was significantly lower for cluster analysis than individual analysis for all estimators.},

Two observers independently recorded the distance and compass bearing to tomtits detected along 36 transect lines in each of two forests (one prefed with non-toxic bait and one not prefed). From these data we calculated (a) male tomtit density in the program DISTANCE and (b) the number of male tomtits within 50 m of each transect line. The number of male tomtit detections increased from September/October to November, probably as a result of changes in bird behaviour. Detections peaked at 21\textendash 25 m from the transect lines, most likely indicating that some closer birds stopped singing on approach of an observer and were undetected. The mean detection distance did not differ significantly between observers in September/October but did differ in November, suggesting changes over time in the relative performance of the observers. Thus, several key assumptions underlying distance sampling were not met. The two methods produced similar population trends, indicating no difference in bias. Also, both indicated that poisoning with prefeeding had either no adverse impact on the tomtit population or no greater adverse impact than poisoning without prefeeding.},

  abstract    = {Knowledge of factors influencing animal distribution and abundance is essential in many areas of ecological research, management, and policy-making. Because common methods for modeling and estimating abundance (e.g., capture-recapture, distance sampling) are sometimes not practical for large areas or elusive species, indices are sometimes used as surrogate measures of abundance. We present an extension of the Royle and Nichols (2003) generalization of the MacKenzie et al. (2002) site-occupancy model that incorporates length of the sampling interval into the model for detection probability. As a result, we obtain a modeling framework that shows how useful information can be extracted from a class of index methods we call indirect detection indices (IDIs). Examples of IDIs include scent station, tracking tube, snow track, tracking plate, and hair snare surveys. Our model is maximum likelihood, and it can be used to estimate site occupancy and model factors influencing patterns of occupancy and abundance in space. Under certain circumstances, it can also be used to estimate abundance. We evaluated model properties using Monte Carlo simulations and illustrate the method with tracking tube and scent station data. We believe this model will be a useful tool for determining factors that influence animal distribution and abundance.},

  abstract    = {Recreational hunting is the primary management tool used by natural resource agencies to control ungulate populations. Although free-ranging ungulates have been studied extensively in North America, relatively little is known about the field behavior of hunters or the factors that influence hunting behavior, except on small study areas where access is limited and controlled. We developed 3 integrated protocols to estimate hunter density, distribution, movements, habitat use, characteristics, and attitudes, which can be used on large areas with unrestricted access. We described how aerial surveys, in conjunction with distance sampling techniques and a Geographic Information System (GIS) database of landscape characteristics, provide estimates of hunter density and a map of hunter distribution and habitat use. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) units issued to hunters to systematically record hunter locations. Hunters also completed a simple questionnaire. We linked these data and used them to obtain detailed information on habitat use, movements, and activity patterns. Whereas aerial surveys are limited to discrete points in time and relate only to aggregations of hunters, data collected on hunters that carry GPS units can be used to study habitat use and distribution at different times of day for individual hunters. Finally, linked responses from a traditional mail or telephone survey to hunter location data collected via GPS units to assess how hunter characteristics (e.g., age, physical condition, attitudes) were related to field behavior. We applied these techniques during a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunting season on a large tract (45,749 ha) of public land in Pennsylvania, USA, with unrestricted hunter access. We estimated density of 7 hunters/1,000 ha (95\% CI: 4.2 to 10.3) in the morning and 6.3 hunters/1,000 ha (95\% CI: 3.5 to 10.0) in the afternoon. We found that hunter density was negatively related to distance from roads and slope. Most hunters preferred stand hunting, especially in the early morning hours (0600-0800 hr; 72\% stationary); more walked or stalked in the afternoon (1400-1600 hr; 58\% stationary). The average maximum distance hunters reached from a road open to public vehicles was 0.84 km (SE = 0.03), and they walked an average of 5.48 km (SE = 0.193) during their daily hunting activities. We believe that the approaches we used for studying hunter behavior will be useful for understanding the connections between hunter attitudes and behavior and hence will allow managers to predict hunter response to changes in harvest regulations. Furthermore, our methods are more accurate than requesting hunters to self-report where they hunted. For example, we found that hunters reported that they walked \textquestiondown 2.5 times farther from the nearest road (x? = 2.23 km, SE = 0.13) than actual distance recorded via GPS units (x? = 0.84 km, SE = 0.03). Our research provides wildlife managers with new knowledge on several levels. At the most basic level, we learned a great deal about what hunters actually do while in the field, rather than simply what they report. Second, linking field behavior with hunter characteristics will provide insights into the likely effects of changing hunter demographics. Finally, linking these data with traditional human-dimensions research topics, such as attitudes toward hunting regulations, may allow managers to better forecast the potential effects of regulation changes on hunter distribution and effort.},

Data collected since 1983 were also examined to indicate trends in mammalian abundance. Civil unrest following the government changeover in 1991 disrupted management of BMNP, leading to an increase in human settlement and livestock densities. The effect of these factors on BMNP's wildlife is assessed and discussed. Most large mammalian wildlife has declined since 1983 but signs of recovery for some species in recent years are positive. The fates of two charismatic endemics are emphasised. BMNP's current population of mountain nyala (\emph{Tragelaphus buxtoni}, an endangered antelope) was estimated to be between 1100 and 1300. This is lower than estimates for the late 1980s, but shows an increase from very low levels recorded following social turmoil during the government changeover in 1991. Data on the Ethiopian wolf (\emph{Canis simensis}, a critically endangered canid) also indicate positive trends in abundance, following severe declines between 1989 and 1992 due to rabies epizootics. Action to reduce human utilisation of parts of BMNP is urgently required to prevent further degradation of the environment and to safeguard the future of both the mountain nyala and Ethiopian wolf. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

During 2000, 34 1-km transects were each sampled twice in the 368.5-ha study area. We observed 46 tortoises with midline carapace lengths ?150 mm (subadults and adults) plus 7 juveniles on transects. For subadults and adults, the encounter rate was 0.63 tortoises/km, and the mean proportion of tortoises observable during radiotelemetry, conducted concurrently with transect sampling, was 82\%. Corrected mean density based on line transects and radiotelemetry was 0.523 tortoises/ha (CV = 22.99, 95\% CI = 0.29-0.79), and absolute abundance in the study area was estimated to be 193 (CV = 23.0\%, CI = 107-291). Using the 2 independent coverages of transects as separate samples, the Lincoln-Petersen mark-recapture estimator produced an abundance estimate of 224 subadult and adult tortoises (CV = 53.9\%, CI = 72-440). Transects measured on the ground over uneven topography resulted in 3\% smaller estimates of density when compared to analysis with transect lengths determined from coordinates plotted on a map. Distance sampling appears to be a feasible method of estimating density of Sonoran Desert populations of the desert tortoise, but transect lengths should be based on mapped rather than measured distances to prevent biases caused by uneven topography.},

Roadside car surveys can be useful to cover large areas and increase the probability of detecting spatially aggregated species or those occurring at very low densities. However, such surveys may be biased due to their inability to handle differences in detectability among species and habitats. We conducted 98 roadside surveys, covering \&gt; 57,000 km across 20 countries and the main world biomes, recording ca. 120,000 parrots from 137 species. We found that larger and more gregarious species are more easily visually detected and at greater distances, with variations among biomes. However, raw estimates of relative parrot abundances (individuals/km) were strongly correlated (r = 0.86\textendash 0.93) with parrot densities (individuals/km2) estimated through distance sampling (DS) models, showing that variability in abundances among species (\&gt;40 orders of magnitude) overcomes any potential detectability bias. While both methods provide similar results, DS cannot be used to study parrot communities or monitor the population trends of all parrot species as it requires a minimum of encounters that are not reached for most species (64\% in our case), mainly the rarest and more threatened. However, DS may be the most suitable choice for some species-specific studies of common species. We summarize the strengths and weaknesses of both methods to guide researchers in choosing the best\textendash fitting option for their particular research hypotheses, characteristics of the species studied, and logistical constraints.},

  abstract    = {Detailed information on year-round distribution, seasonal abundance and inter-annual trends of a given species is essential for any conservation effort. However, for most odontocetes this knowledge is rather limited. Therefore, area-specific management or conservation plans are often difficult to argue for. This is also true for the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), although it is the most common cetacean species in the North Sea. Knowledge of the current status of local stocks as well as fine scale information on the temporal use of certain areas by the species is incomplete. One area of concern is the southern North Sea where the abundance of harbour porpoises has declined in the twentieth century. Recent studies using stranding data and observations from seabird surveys indicate a comeback of the species along the Dutch and Belgian coast. However, data on other regions of the southern North Sea is sparse. Between 2002 and 2004, we undertook 25 aerial line transect surveys (11,000 km on effort; altitude = 250 and 600 ft) in a 2,500 km2 coastal area off Eastern Frisia, Germany including a small portion of Dutch coastal waters. The data were g(0) corrected using a double platform approach and analysed with distance sampling software. A total of 426 harbour porpoises were sighted, including eight calves. Densities ranged between \textexclamdown 0.1 and 1.62 individuals/km2 with peaks in February and July 2003 as well as February and May 2004. The results of our study show that harbour porpoises are present in the coastal part of the southern North Sea even during their reproductive period. However, they seem to appear in lower numbers and much more irregular than in other areas, for example off Northern Frisia. The results of this study support the recent findings that despite a decline in the mid-twentieth century, harbour porpoises are now at times quite abundant in the southern North Sea. The underlying factors of this 'return' should be investigated using a combination of surveys and satellite telemetry. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag and AWI 2006.},

  abstract    = {The subdesert mesite, a terrestrial non-passerine bird endemic to the Mikea Forest of southwest Madagascar, is currently classified as globally threatened (category: Vulnerable). However, accurate assessment of threat in accordance with the IUCN Red List criteria (A, B and C) requires data on effective population size, area of habitat occupied and rate of decline, none of which is available for this species. Here we present the first empirical estimates of its population size using five complementary methods, three incorporating data on territory size and two using data gathered during call-playback surveys conducted throughout its entire global range. Estimates vary from 98,000 to 152,000 individuals, with the most reliable possibly being that generated by distance sampling (115,000). This figure is more than an order of magnitude greater than the only published estimate of \textexclamdown 10,000 individuals. By analysing data on forest cover change, we estimate the population of the subdesert mesite to have declined by, at most, 10\% in three generations. Although the rate of deforestation in 1994-1999 is double that calculated for 1962-1994, it is deemed unlikely that the population will decline by 20\% over the next three generations. As such the species fails to meet criterion A. Although the subdesert mesite's range and area of occupancy are small, they are not fragmented and do not comprise fewer than 10 locations. Consequently, this species does not meet criterion B. Further, the species fails to meet criterion C, for which a maximum of 10,000 mature adults is required. According to IUCN (2000 Red List of Threatened Species) this species should therefore be downlisted in status. We discuss why it still warrants conservation attention and suggest the need for modifications to the criteria thresholds in relation to basic information about the ecology and taxonomic distinctness of species. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This aim of this survey was to evaluate the use of the distance sampling technique to estimate densities of the species in the Pantanal wetland, as well as to analyze the applicability of the method for a monitoring program. The surveys were conducted on roads from vehicles and also on foot along 26 parallel transects in November 1999 and 2000 at Campo Dora ranch, south-central Pantanal, Brazil. Deer densities were estimated using the program DISTANCE, and the program MONITOR was used to run a power analysis to estimate the probability of detection of a decline in the population. The deer density estimated from vehicles, with data from both years, was 9.81{$\pm$}3.8 individual/km2, and 5.53{$\pm$}0.68 individuals/km2 from transects sampled on foot. The power analysis of these data revealed a monitoring program would require at least two surveys per year over seven years to obtain a 90\% chance of detecting a 5\% decline in the population. Our results also indicate surveys from roads are not recommended for pampas deer counts as the animals appear to keep a relatively safe distance from cars.},

  abstract  = {The Iberian porpoise population is small and under potentially unsustainable removal by fisheries bycatch. Recently, a marine Site of Community Importance (SCI) was legally approved in Portugal, but no measures ensued to promote porpoise conservation. Information about porpoise abundance and distribution is fundamental to guide any future conservation measures. Annual aerial surveys conducted between 2011 and 2015 show a low overall porpoise abundance and density (2254 individuals; 0.090 ind/km2, CV = 21.99\%) in the Portuguese coast. The highest annual porpoise estimates were registered in 2013 (3207 individuals, 0.128 ind/km2), followed by a sharp decrease in 2014 (1653 individuals, 0.066 ind/km2). The porpoise density and abundance estimated in 2015 remained lower than the 2013 estimates. A potential distribution analysis of the Iberian porpoise population was performed using ensembles of small models (ESMs) with MaxEnt and showed that the overall habitat suitability is particularly high in the Portuguese northern area. The analysis also suggested a different pattern in porpoise potential distribution across the study period. These results emphasize the importance of further porpoise population assessments to fully understand the spatial and temporal porpoise habitat use in the Iberian Peninsula as well as the urgent need for on-site threat mitigation measures.},

  abstract    = {When an area is brought under protection, current animal populations and their habitat preferences need to be assessed to predict population trends and future habitat availability. Using data from walking transects, we estimated the size of native ungulate populations on an abandoned cattle ranch in a coastal savannah in Tanzania, now included in the new Saadani National Park. Data were analysed with DISTANCE sampling and conventional strip transect techniques and were compared with results of previous wildlife counts. Few individuals of mainly browsing species were present in former cattle grazing areas exhibiting high bush-encroachment while a ten times higher biomass of browsers and grazers was found in the cattle-unmodified savannah. Population sizes of some species increased twofold between 1991 and 2001 within the entire area but neither population size nor species richness increased in the abandoned rangeland during our 3-year study period from 2001 to 2003. We conclude that the former ranch has potential for future recolonization by wild ungulates. Resettlement will take place gradually with 'pioneer-species' facilitating the entry of more demanding species. Habitat restoration through wildlife can be observed and quantified on Mkwaja Ranch which will be of importance for future management of native ungulates reclaiming abandoned rangeland. \textcopyright{} 2005 African Journal of Ecology.},

  abstract    = {Caribbean hurricanes often impact terrestrial vertebrates in forested environments. On 21 September 1998, Hurricane Georges impacted Puerto Rico with sustained winds in excess of 166 km/hr, causing damage to forests of the island's principal mountain range; the Cordillera Central. We estimated forest frog abundance and diversity from call counts conducted along marked transects before and after Hurricane Georges in two forests reserves of the Cordillera Central (Maricao and Guilarte). We used distance sampling to estimate density of Eleutherodactylus coqui and recorded counts of other species. After the hurricane, the abundance of E. coqui increased in both reserves compared to prehurricane levels while abundance of other frog species decreased. In Maricao, relative abundance of E. richmondi (P = 0.013) and E. brittoni (P = 0.034) were significantly lower after the hurricane. Moreover, species richness and evenness of the Maricao and Guilarte frog assemblages declined after the hurricane. Our results on abundance patterns of the forest frog assemblages of Maricao and Guilarte Forests were similar to those reported from the Luquillo Experimental Forest after Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. Long-term demographic patterns of the forest frog assemblages in the Cordillera Central may be associated with changes due to the ecological succession in post-hurricane forests.

Our study is based on a camera and net trawl survey conducted in 1974, which we repeated between 2003 and 2005 on the southern New England shelf break. Although the overall biomass of red crabs was estimated to be higher than in 1974, the abundance of large males, which are targeted by the fishery, was considerably lower. In particular, the biomass of large males ({$\geq$}114 mm carapace width), considered in 1974 to be marketable, declined by 42\%. Declines were most evident at depths and regions most accessible to the fishing fleet based in southern New England. With the change in fishery selectivity towards smaller male crabs, the abundance of currently harvestable crabs is about equal to 1974 levels. No declines were observed in the biomass of female and smaller male crabs not targeted by the fishery. Indeed, the abundance of juveniles appears considerably higher than in 1974. Perhaps, adverse effects on reproduction attributable to a reduction in the numbers of large males may be a consequence of fishing, but fishery impacts and productivity are difficult to assess because key biological information is lacking.},

  abstract  = {Biological production in the oceanic zone (i.e. waters beyond the continental shelves) is typically spatially patchy and strongly seasonal. In response, seabirds have adapted to move rapidly within and between ocean basins, making them important pelagic consumers. Studies in the Pacific, Southern and Indian Oceans have shown that seabirds are relatively abundant in major frontal systems, with species composition varying by water mass. In contrast, surprisingly little was known about seabird distribution in the oceanic North Atlantic until recent tracking showed that relative abundance and diversity peak in the Sub-polar Frontal Zone, west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, now proposed as a Marine Protected Area. However, absolute seabird abundance, distribution, age and species composition, and their potential environmental drivers in the oceanic temperate NW Atlantic remain largely unknown. Consequently, we systematically surveyed seabirds and environmental conditions across this area by ship in June, 2017, then modelled the density of common species as functions of environmental covariates, validating model predictions against independent tracking data. Medium-sized petrels (99.8\%), especially Great Shearwaters (Ardenna gravis, 63\%), accounted for the majority of total avian biomass, which correlated at the macroscale with net primary production and peaked at the sub-polar front. At the mesoscale, the density of each species was associated with sea surface temperature, indicating zonation by water mass. Most species also exhibited scale-dependent associations with eddies and fronts. Approximately 51, 26, 23, 7 and 1 \% of the currently estimated Atlantic populations of Cory's Shearwaters (Calonectris borealis), Great Shearwaters, Sooty Shearwaters (A. grisea), Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) and Leach's Storm-petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) occurred in the area during our survey, many of which were undergoing moult (a vital maintena nce activity). For some species, these estimates are higher than suggested by tracking, probably due to the presence of immatures and birds from untracked populations. Our results support the conclusion that MPA status is warranted and provide a baseline against which future changes can be assessed. Moreover, they indicate potential drivers of seabird abundance and diversity in the oceanic zone of the North Atlantic that should be investigated further.},

Small mammals \textexclamdown 0.2\^A kg were trapped and a vegetation survey was performed. Livestock and some medium-sized wildlife species were most abundant in livestock areas, while large-sized wildlife species were mainly restricted to wildlife areas. Most red-listed species were confined to the national park. The influence of land use on abundances changed moderately between seasons. However, cattle moved into wildlife areas during the wet season. Differences in species richness and diversity were most pronounced during the dry season. The trapping frequency of small mammals was highest in the national park. Differences in vegetation structure included sparser field layer and higher cover of an invasive shrub in livestock areas. Our study shows the importance of protected areas for many wildlife species in the Kalahari. It also shows the value of a multi-species approach for investigating the effects of land use on wildlife communities.},

  abstract            = {Estimates of the size or density of wildlife populations are essential for effective management. Aerial surveys often are the only practical way of obtaining these estimates for large mammals ranging over a large area. Different aerial survey techniques are available. This paper reports on a study that estimated abundance and population density of wild horses (Equus caballus) in the Australian Alps using helicopter aerial surveys. Three frequently used techniques were compared simultaneously: strip counts, mark-recapture, and line transect. Using data on horse groups over a strip width of 200 m, estimates of horse abundance from mark-recapture analyses were higher (N=3,045 modified Petersen and N=3,298 Huggins estimators, respectively) than from strip counts (N=1,814 and N=2,242 for observers 1 and 2, respectively). Use of line-transect analysis yielded the highest estimates of abundance (N=5,200-5,830, population density D=1.86-2.09 km{$^{-2}$}). The coefficient of variation (CV) of estimates varied from 22\% for strip counts (0-50 m) to 28\% for mark-recapture analysis (0-50 m) and 31-32\% for line-transect analysis (0-200 m). Mark-recapture estimates of horse abundance from the modified Petersen estimator were substantially lower when the strip width was 200 m (N=2,061) compared with a strip width of 50 m (N=4,345). These results suggested that in aerial surveys using strip or mark-recapture analyses, the effect of wide strip width should be examined; otherwise estimates may be strongly negatively biased. Observer 1 estimated mean group size of 4.91+-0.61 SE horses and observer 2 estimated mean group size as 3.79+-0.57 SE horses. Mean group size observed from the ground was 5.65+-0.51 SE. We recommend that aerial surveys be implemented periodically using line-transect methodology to monitor trends in wild horse abundance in the Australian Alps.},

Recently, distance sampling has been adopted as the most appropriate method and is now becoming the standard monitoring protocol in all tiger range countries in south Asia. However, the accuracy of the density estimates generated by this method has not been assessed. From total counts within habitat blocks, we obtained accurate density estimates of ungulates within three main habitats in Bardia National Park, Nepal. We then applied the distance sampling method in the same habitats and compared the results. Distance sampling on foot in dense habitats (riverine forest and tallgrass floodplain) violated method assumptions, and sampling from vehicle along roads gave biased estimates. Sampling from elephant back worked well in all habitat types, but owing to their behaviour, the density of barking deer \textexclamdown I\textquestiondown Muntiacus muntjak\textexclamdown/I\textquestiondown{} was underestimated. The accuracy of the estimates varied with sampling effort; for the very abundant chital deer \textexclamdown I\textquestiondown Axis axis\textexclamdown/I\textquestiondown, estimates varied markedly at \&\#60;200 animal observations, but converged at larger sample sizes to a similar point estimate as intensive block counts when approaching 300 observations. For the less abundant species, with \&\#60;20 observations along \&\#62;100\&\#8201;km of transect lines, the confidence intervals were quite high, and, hence, of limited value for detecting short-term populations trends. It is therefore difficult to obtain accurate density estimates of rare species by the distance method. In areas consisting of dense habitats, we recommend that the food base of tiger be estimated by distance sampling from elephant back, not on foot, directed at the main and most abundant prey species. For rare species, encounter rates obtained simultaneously may then serve as indices of relative abundances.},

The operation used 12 g toxic (1080 at 0.15\% weight/weight) cereal baits sown at 3 kg/ha. Transects were established at three neighbouring sites; two within the 1080 poison area, and one outside. The re-sighting of l4 out of 15 banded male tomtits at one site within the 1080 operation indicated that mortality was low. This was backed up by results from a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design to analyse density estimates from distance sampling along transects. We analysed the change in counts of territorial males before and after the operation based on the same transect surveys. This also showed little impact of poisoning on tomtits, and indicated that loss rates greater than 8.4\% due to 1080 were incompatible with the data (95\% one-sided confidence bound). Counts of territorial males gave a much tighter confidence bound than the banding or distance sampling results. Of the techniques applied, the counting of territorial males appears to have the most promise for providing high-precision estimates of short-term impacts, by taking full advantage of the territorial habits of male tomtits in spring. However, distance sampling shows potential for providing the basis for longer-term monitoring of tomtit populations. The transect-based approaches involved substantially fewer resources than banding for estimating short-term impacts, and offer a considerably less-intensive means of longer-term monitoring of tomtits.},

Two examples are the minimum number known alive from capture and release studies, and aerial surveys where the detection probability is not estimated from a sightability model, marked animals, or distance sampling. Both the mark-recapture and distance-sampling estimators are techniques to estimate the probability of detection of an individual animal (or cluster of animals), which is then used to correct a count of animals. However, often the number of animals in a survey is inadequate to compute an estimate of the detection probability and hence correct the count. Modern methods allow sophisticated modelling to estimate the detection probability, including incorporating covariates to provide additional information about the detection probability. Examples from both distance and mark-recapture sampling are presented to demonstrate the approach. \textcopyright{} CSIRO 2005.},

We evaluated aerial line transect (LT) for estimating pronghorn antelope abundance in Oregon. We conducted surveys in 2 Oregon Big Game Management Units (BGU) during May 1998 and 1 BGU during May 1999 and 2000. We found LT sampling provided reasonable estimates of population size in our survey areas where densities were lower than in other states already utilizing the technique. However, 95\% confidence intervals for estimates were large. In addition, application to low-density populations was more expensive compared to traditional survey methods because additional effort was required to obtain desired sample size and resulting precision. Relative comparisons with historic trend counts and management implications are discussed.},

  abstract    = {Effective wildlife conservation strategies require an understanding of how fluctuating environmental conditions affect sensitive life stages. As part of a long-term study, we examined post-fledging and post-independence survival of 89 radio-marked juvenile Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) produced from 48 nests in northern Arizona, USA, during 1998-2001. Information-theoretic methods were used to examine within- and among-year variation in survival relative to environmental (prey abundance, weather), territory (hatching date, brood size), and individual (gender, body mass) sources of variation. The results support age- and cohort-specific differences in survival that were best explained by behaviors occurring at distinct stages of juvenile development, annual changes in the density of primary bird and mammal prey species, and gender-related differences in body mass. Survival between fledging and independence increased linearly with age and varied among annual cohorts of radio-marked juveniles from 0.81 (95\% CI 5 0.60-0.93) to 1.00 (95\% CI 5 0.95-1.00) in association with annual differences in prey density; the slope coefficient for the additive effect of prey density on survival was 1.12 (95\% CI 5 0.06-2.19). Survival declined to 0.71 (95\% CI 5 0.60-0.93) shortly after juveniles initiated dispersal (weeks 8-12 post-fledging) and moved to more open habitats at lower elevations. Survival was not closely associated with weather or territory-level parameters. A comparison of the predictions of environmental-, territory-, and individual-based models of survival demonstrated that food availability was the primary factor limiting juvenile survival. This finding indicates that forest management prescriptions designed to support abundant prey populations while providing forest structural conditions that allow goshawks to access their prey within breeding areas should benefit juvenile survival. \textcopyright{} 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Aims: To provide an up-to-date estimate of the population size of Capercaillie in Britain and to identify habitat use by Capercaillie in winter. Methods: Using the census technique of distance sampling, flushed birds were counted along line transects walked in stratified random blocks of forest within the species' range. The same transects were surveyed as used in the 1992-94 survey, enabling direct comparison of the results. Densities were estimated using the DISTANCE program, combining these data with those from a similar survey of Capercaillie in 1992-94 to allow a more robust estimate of the detection function. Results: The Capercaillie population was estimated to be 1073 birds (95\% CL 549-2041). This represents a decline of 51\% between the two surveys, at a rate of 13\% per annum. Females declined at a faster rate than males resulting in a marked change in the sex-ratio, which was close to 1:1 for the entire population. Bird densities declined by a similar magnitude in both native pinewoods and other woodlands in comparison to 1992-94. Even so, densities were significantly higher in native pinewoods (1.63 km-2) than in other woodlands (0.43 km-2), which comprised largely planted Scots Pine \emph{Pinus sylvestris}, larch \emph{Larix spp.}, Lodgepole Pine \emph{Pinus contorta} and Sitka Spruce \emph{Picea sitchensis}. Overall, Capercaillie tended to use forest stands with a high proportion of Scots Pine and Blaeberry Vaccinium myrtilus; features that are typical of native pinewoods and old pine plantations. Conclusions: The Capercaillie population has undergone a dramatic decline during the last five years. The decline has been greater for females and has occurred across habitats. This information is helping to focus efforts in securing the future for Capercaillie in Scotland, which has now become a major conservation challenge.},

  abstract    = {ABSTRACT: Small cetaceans (dolphins and porpoises) face serious anthropogenic threats in coastal habitats. These include bycatch in fisheries; exposure to noise, plastic and chemical pollution; disturbance from boaters; and climate change. Generating reliable abundance estimates is essential to assess sustainability of bycatch in fishing gear or any other form of anthropogenic removals and to design conservation and recovery plans for endangered species. Cetacean abundance estimates are lacking from many coastal waters of many developing countries. Lack of funding and training opportunities makes it difficult to fill in data gaps. Even if international funding were found for surveys in developing countries, building local capacity would be necessary to sustain efforts over time to detect trends and monitor biodiversity loss. Large-scale, shipboard surveys can cost tens of thousands of US dollars each day. We focus on methods to generate preliminary abundance estimates from low-cost, small-boat surveys that embrace a \^A`training-while-doing\^A' approach to fill in data gaps while simultaneously building regional capacity for data collection. Our toolkit offers practical guidance on simple design and field data collection protocols that work with small boats and small budgets, but expect analysis to involve collaboration with a quantitative ecologist or statistician. Our audience includes independent scientists, government conservation agencies, NGOs and indigenous coastal communities, with a primary focus on fisheries bycatch. We apply our Animal Counting Toolkit to a small-boat survey in Canada\^A's Pacific coastal waters to illustrate the key steps in collecting line transect survey data used to estimate and monitor marine mammal abundance.},

  abstract    = {Information on animal abundance and distribution is at the cornerstone of many wildlife and conservation strategies. However, these data can be difficult and costly to obtain for cetacean species. The expense of sufficient ship time to conduct design-unbiased line transect surveys may be simply out of reach for researchers in many countries, which nonetheless grapple with problems of conservation of endangered species, by-catch of small cetaceans in commercial fisheries, and progression toward ecosystem-based fisheries management. Recently developed spatial modeling techniques show promise for estimating wildlife abundance using non-randomized surveys, but have yet to receive much field-testing in areas where designed surveys have also been conducted. Effort and sightings data were collected along 9 650 km of transects aboard ships of opportunity in the Southern Ocean during the austral summers of 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. Generalized additive models with generalized cross-validation were used to express heterogeneity of cetacean sightings as functions of spatial covariates. Models were used to map predicted densities and to estimate abundance of humpback, minke, and fin whales in the Drake Passage and along the Antarctic Peninsula. All species' distribution maps showed strong density gradients, which were robust to jackknife resampling when each of 14 trips was removed sequentially with replacement. Looped animations of model predictions of whale density illustrate uncertainty in distribution estimates in a way that is informative to non-scientists. The best abundance estimate for humpback whales was 1 829 (95\% CI: 978-3 422). Abundance of fin whales was 4 487 (95\% CI: 1 326-15 179) and minke whales was 1,544 (95\% CI: 1,221-1,953). These estimates agreed roughly with those reported from a designed survey conducted in the region during the previous austral summer. These estimates assumed that all animals on the trackline were detected, but preliminary results suggest that any negative bias due to violation of this assumption was likely small. Similarly, current methodological limitations prohibit inclusion of all known sources of uncertainty in the favored variance estimator. Meanwhile, our approach can be seen generally as an inexpensive pilot study to identify areas of predicted high density that could be targeted to: inform stratified designs for future line transect surveys, making them less expensive and more precise; increase efficiency of future photo-identification or biopsy studies; identify candidate time-area fisheries closures to minimize by-catch; or direct ecotourism activities. The techniques are likely to apply to areas where funding is limiting, where cetacean studies or wilderness-based tourism are just beginning, or in regions where even a very rough estimate of animal abundance is needed for conservation or management purposes.

  abstract  = {The rapidly developing technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) extends to the availability of aerial surveys for wildlife research and management. However, regulations limiting drone operations to visual line of sight (VLOS) seriously affect the design of surveys, as flight paths must be concentrated within small sampling blocks. Such a design is inferior to spatially unrestricted randomized designs available if operations beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) are allowed. We used computer simulations to assess whether the VLOS rule affects the accuracy and precision of wildlife density estimates derived from drone collected data. We tested two alternative flight plans (VLOS vs. BVLOS) in simulated surveys of low-, medium- and high-density populations of a hypothetical ungulate species with three levels of effort (one to three repetitions). The population density was estimated using the ratio estimate and distance sampling method. The observed differences in the accuracy and precision of estimates from the VLOS and BVLOS surveys were relatively small and negligible. Only in the case of the low-density population (2 ind./100 ha) surveyed once was the VLOS design inferior to BVLOS, delivering biased and less precise estimates. These results show that while the VLOS regulations complicate survey logistics and interfere with random survey design, the quality of derived estimates does not have to be compromised. We advise testing alternative survey variants with the aid of computer simulations to achieve reliable estimates while minimizing survey costs.},

Second, we identified occupied habitat using observations from a systematic inventory of potential habitat from 1995-1999 and from a study of breeding biology from 2000-2002. Third, we estimated breeding densities within a framework designed specifically for distance sampling. We mapped 82750 ha of potential habitat. We recorded 2516 plover locations from which we estimated 29 176 ha of occupied habitat. We estimated densities for 14 960 ha of potential habitat. Average plover density from 2000-2002 was 7.9 {$\pm$} 0.9 (SE) breeding adults km-2, a high value compared with other sites. We calculated a population of 1187 {$\pm$} 140 (SE) plovers in the distance sampling area. Assuming density in our sampling area was similar for all documented occupied habitat, we estimated the population of plovers in South Park at 2310 adults.

  abstract    = {Uncertainties in species definitions can have important consequences for biodiversity conservation because taxonomic rank is used as a criterion to assess the conservation priorities of threatened organisms. The Vulnerable St Lucia whiptail lizard \emph{Cnemidophorus vanzoi}, considered a single species, is the sole representative of its genus in the Caribbean region, found on Maria Major and Maria Minor islands off the coast of St Lucia. However, a recent study revealed significant morphological and phylogenetic differences between the two populations and recommended they should be managed as two separate entities. We surveyed the two populations and estimated them to comprise 1,985 and 29 individuals on Maria Major and Minor, respectively. The Maria Minor population is currently at a critically low level and consequently highly susceptible to demographic and genetic stochasticity and catastrophic events, in particular the colonization of invasive mammalian predators. If our goal is to conserve biodiversity and evolutionary potential we face a dilemma in formulating the optimum strategy for the management of these two threatened populations on the species boundary. We discuss some potential management options but also raise this issue for discussion in the conservation biology community. \textcopyright{} 2006 FFI.},

  abstract   = {The line transect distance sampling method provides unbiased estimates of abundance when organisms are distributed randomly or line transects are laid out randomly, sample sizes are large and other assumptions of the method are met; such, however, is rarely the case in real life. We conducted a simulation study to investigate how spatial distribution and density of objects, and total length, layout and number of transects influence bias, precision, and accuracy of estimates of abundance obtained by distance sampling along line transects. Overall, density estimated using the distance sampling method was within 4.9\% of the true density, but it varied substantially depending upon spatial distribution of objects. Of the three spatial distribution patterns considered, estimates of density were least biased, and most precise and accurate when objects were distributed randomly; they were most biased, and least precise and accurate when objects followed a clumped distribution. The estimated bias (\% difference between true density and estimated density) for clumped, random and uniform distribution was 13.1\%, -0.4\%, and 2.1\%, respectively; precision (\% coefficient of variation, CV( D\textasciicircum{} )) was 13.7\%, 9.1\%, and 9.2\%; and accuracy (root mean-squared error, RMSE) was 27.9\%, 7.4\%, and 11.7\% for clumped, random, and uniform distribution, respectively. Increasing total transect length and using several short transects (as opposed to few long transects) generally reduced bias, and increased accuracy and precision of estimates of abundance. A systematic layout of transects worked as well as, or better than, random layout, except when objects were distributed uniformly in space. This study advances the utility of the line transect method by providing information both on how study design affects accuracy and precision of abundance estimates, and how it can be improved when assumptions of the method are not strictly met based on a priori knowledge of the spatial distribution and presumed density of the target organism through appropriate changes in the study design.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the abundance, density and cluster size of Black Crowned Cranes. Seventy four and 56 transects were examined in 14,764 ha of land in 2015 (wet season) and 2016 (dry season), respectively. Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling model was employed. The encounter rate, detection probability, expected cluster size and density were parameters for estimation. Hazard rate key ({$\sigma$}=0.3), detection function g(x)=1-exp[-(x/{$\sigma$}) \^(-{$\beta$})], x{$\leq$}w was selected for analysis. Cluster analysis based on exact sizes was computed by regression of log(s(i)) on g(x(i)). The minimum Akaike Information Criterion was chosen during estimator selection. The result showed that the cluster size of cranes during the wet season in wetland and farmland habitats regression estimate were Cwi=0.73+0.16*xi; and Cfi=0.52+-0.21*xi, respectively. Similarly, in 2016, the regression estimate of wetland and farmland were Cwi=0.16+0.56*xi and Cfi=0.20+-0.34*xi, respectively. During the wet season in 2015, in the wetland habitat, the crane density was estimated 0.21768{$\pm$}0.82 per hectare, and the total population (N) was estimated to be 1472{$\pm$}554.62. Whereas in the farmland, crane density was estimated 0.79921 E-01{$\pm$}0.13370E-01 per hectare, and the total population (N) was estimated to be 639. The total density and abundance of Black Crowned Cranes during the wet season in 2015 was estimated. The wet season pooled density estimate was 14.304 cranes per 100 hectares with (\% CV~=~26.75, df~=~50.2, 95\%CI= 0.84355E-01=CI~=~0.24254) and the population size was estimated to be 2112 cranes with (\% CV~=~26.75, df~=~50.2, 95\%CI~=~1245=CI~=~3581). During the dry season, in 2016, the crane density was estimated 0.3625{$\pm$}0.6958E-01 per hectare, and the total population (N) was estimated to be 2452{$\pm$}470.65. In the farmland, the cranes density was estimated 0.13904{$\pm$}0.14809E-01 per hectare, and the total population (N) was estimated to be 1112{$\pm$}118.44. The dry season pooled density estimate was 24.142 cranes per 100 hectares with (\%CV=13.62, df~=~164.02, 95\%CI~=~0.18473=CI= 0.31550) and the population was estimated to be 3564 cranes with (\%CV=13.62, df~=~164.02, 95\%CI~=~2727=CI~=~4658). In conclusion, the cluster size of cranes in wetland and farmland habitat during the dry season showed that the species consisted of a small number of cranes per family. However, the wetland habitat was more suitable than the farmland in consisting of larger cluster size and overall population of cranes. Wetland degradation is a threat for cranes.},

  abstract    = {Large whales were extensively hunted in coastal waters off Alaska, but current distribution, population sizes and trends are poorly known. Line transect surveys were conducted in coastal waters of the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula in the summer of 2001-2003. Abundances of three species were estimated by conventional and multiple covariate distance sampling (MCDS) methods. Time series of abundance estimates were used to derive rates of increase for fin whales (\emph{Balaenoptera physalus}) and humpback whales (\emph{Megaptera novaeangliae}). Fin whales occurred primarily from the Kenai Peninsula to the Shumagin Islands, but were abundant only near the Semidi Islands and Kodiak. Humpback whales were found from the Kenai Peninsula to Umnak Island and were more abundant near Kodiak, the Shumagin Islands and north of Unimak Pass. Minke whales (\emph{B. acutorostrata}) occurred primarily in the Aleutian Islands, with a few sightings south of the Alaska Peninsula and near Kodiak Island. Humpback whales were observed in large numbers in their former whaling grounds. In contrast, high densities of fin whales were not observed around the eastern Aleutian Islands, where whaling occurred. Average abundance estimates (95\% CI) for fin, humpback and minke whales were 1652 (1142-2389), 2644 (1899-3680), and 1233 (656-2315), respectively. Annual rates of increase were estimated at 4.8\% (95\% CI=4.1-5.4\%) for fin and 6.6\% (5.2-8.6\%) for humpback whales. This study provides the first estimate of the rate of increase of fin whales in the North Pacific Ocean. The estimated trends are consistent with those of other recovering baleen whales. There were no sightings of blue or North Pacific right whales, indicating the continued depleted status of these species.},

  abstract     = {Agassiz's desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), a threatened species of the southwestern United States, has severely declined to the point where 76\% of populations in critical habitat (Tortoise Conservation Areas) are below viability. The potential for rapid recovery of wild populations is low because females require 12{\textendash}20 years to reach reproductive maturity and produce few eggs annually. We report on a 34-year mark-recapture study of tortoises initiated in 1979 at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area in the western Mojave Desert, California, USA, and provide substantive data on challenges faced by the species. In 1980, the United States Congress designated the Research Natural Area and protected the land from recreational vehicles, livestock grazing, and mining with a wildlife-permeable fence. The 7.77-km{$^2$} study area, centered on interpretive facilities, included land both within the Natural Area and outside the fence. We expected greater benefits to accrue to the tortoises and habitat inside compared to outside. Our objectives were to conduct a demographic study, analyze and model changes in the tortoise population and habitat, and compare the effectiveness of fencing to protect populations and habitat inside the fence versus outside, where populations and habitat were unprotected. We conducted surveys in spring in each of 7 survey years from 1979, when the fence was under construction, through 2012. We compared populations inside to those outside the fence by survey year for changes in distribution, structure by size and relative age, sex ratios, death rates of adults, and causes of death for all sizes of tortoises. We used a Bayesian implementation of a Jolly Seber model for mark-recapture data. We modeled detection, density, growth and transition of tortoises to larger size-age classes, movements from inside the protective fence to outside and vice versa, and survival. After the second and subsequent survey years, we added surveys to monitor vegetation and habitat changes, conduct health assessments, and collect data on counts of predators and predator sign. At the beginning of the study, counts and densities for all sizes of tortoises were high, but densities were approximately 24\% higher inside the fence than outside. By 2002, the low point in densities, densities had declined 90\% inside the fence and 95\% outside. Between 2002 and 2012, the population inside the fence showed signs of improving with a 54\% increase in density. Outside the fence, densities remained low. At the end of the study, when we considered the initial differences in location, densities inside the fence were roughly 2.5 times higher than outside. The pattern of densities was similar for male and female adults. When evaluating survival by blocks of years, survivorship was higher in 1979{\textendash}1989 than in 1989{\textendash}2002 (the low point) and highest from 2002 to 2012. Recruitment and survival of adult females into the population was important for growing the population, but survival of all sizes, including juveniles, was also critical. Major events and activities driving the decline in populations both inside and outside the fence included illegal collecting, upper respiratory tract disease, and hyperpredation by the common raven (Corvus corax) on juvenile tortoises. Other sources of death were gunshots, vehicles, and predation by mammals. Outside the fence, fragmentation and deterioration of habitat was a critical driver. Between the first and last surveys, 2 different ecosystem processes were underway: recovery of vegetation and soils from grazing and vehicles inside the fence and continued deterioration outside the fence. Habitat outside the fence became increasingly denuded of shrubs and fragmented by roads and trails, and habitat fragments increased 50-fold. Outside the fence, biomass of non-native annual plants was higher and the cover of shrubs was lower, a reflection of ongoing deterioration. These changes and losses of habitat resulted in loss of shrub cover and sites for burrows, reduction in preferred food plants, and greater exposure to predators and extremes in temperature. Overall, the tortoise population and habitat inside the fence appeared to benefit from protection and showed signs of recovery at the end of the study. Fencing, control of vehicular access, and removal of livestock grazing were among several recommended management actions for critical habitat in the first recovery plan in 1994. At the end of the study, the Natural Area remained as 1 of 2 fenced, official protected areas for the species in the geographic range. We attribute fencing to continuing higher densities of adults inside the fence compared with outside the fence and promising signs of recovery. Densities of adults at the Natural Area also were 2.3 to 5.5 times higher than in 16 of the 17 Tortoise Conservation Areas (critical habitat units) within the geographic range. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

La tortue du d{\'e}sert ou goph{\`e}re d'Agassiz (Gopherus agassizii), une esp{\`e}ce menac{\'e}e du sud-ouest des {\'E}tats-Unis, a subi une forte r{\'e}gression, au point que 76\% des populations dans l'habitat essentiel (zones de protection des tortues) sont en dessous du seuil de viabilit{\'e}. Le potentiel de r{\'e}g{\'e}n{\'e}ration rapide des populations sauvages est faible, car les femelles n'atteignent leur maturit{\'e} reproductive qu'apr{\`e}s 12 {\`a} 20 ans, et m{\^e}me alors, elles ne pondent que peu d'{\oe}ufs chaque ann{\'e}e. Nous pr{\'e}sentons ici une {\'e}tude par marquage-recapture sur les tortues, entreprise en 1979 et conduite pendant 34 ans dans la zone naturelle de recherche sur les tortues du d{\'e}sert, dans l'ouest du d{\'e}sert de Mojave en Californie, et nous fournissons des donn{\'e}es concr{\`e}tes sur les difficult{\'e}s rencontr{\'e}es par cette esp{\`e}ce. En 1980, le Congr{\`e}s am{\'e}ricain a d{\'e}limit{\'e} la zone naturelle de recherche et install{\'e} une cl{\^o}ture perm{\'e}able {\`a} la faune pour prot{\'e}ger le terrain des v{\'e}hicules r{\'e}cr{\'e}atifs, du p{\^a}turage de b{\'e}tail et de l'exploitation mini{\`e}re. La zone {\'e}tudi{\'e}e de 7,77 km{$^2$}, situ{\'e}e autour des installations didactiques, comprenait des terres {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur et {\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur de la zone naturelle cl{\^o}tur{\'e}e. Nous nous attendions {\`a} ce que les tortues et leur habitat se trouvent davantage {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur qu'{\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur de la zone. Nos objectifs {\'e}taient de mener une {\'e}tude d{\'e}mographique, d'analyser et de mod{\'e}liser les changements dans la population de tortues et leur habitat, et d'{\'e}valuer l'efficacit{\'e} de la cl{\^o}ture sur la protection des populations et de l'habitat avec une comparaison entre l'int{\'e}rieur et l'ext{\'e}rieur de la zone. Nous avons effectu{\'e} des relev{\'e}s au printemps de sept ann{\'e}es entre 1979, lorsque la cl{\^o}ture {\'e}tait en construction, et 2012. Nous avons compar{\'e} les populations {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur et {\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture entre ces sept ann{\'e}es: changements dans la distribution, structure selon la taille et l'{\^a}ge relatif, proportion des sexes, taux de mortalit{\'e} des adultes et causes de d{\'e}c{\`e}s pour toutes les tailles de tortues. Nous avons utilis{\'e} une impl{\'e}mentation bay{\'e}sienne d'un mod{\`e}le Jolly-Seber pour les donn{\'e}es de marquage-recapture. Nous avons mod{\'e}lis{\'e} la d{\'e}tection, la densit{\'e}, la croissance et la transition des tortues vers les classes de taille-{\^a}ge sup{\'e}rieures, leurs mouvements de l'int{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture de protection vers l'ext{\'e}rieur et vice versa, et leur survie. {\`A} partir de la deuxi{\`e}me ann{\'e}e, nous avons ajout{\'e} des relev{\'e}s pour surveiller les changements de la v{\'e}g{\'e}tation et de l'habitat, {\'e}valuer la sant{\'e} des tortues et recueillir des donn{\'e}es sur le nombre de pr{\'e}dateurs et les signes de pr{\'e}sence de pr{\'e}dateurs. Au d{\'e}but de l'{\'e}tude, les d{\'e}nombrements et la densit{\'e} des populations de toutes les tailles de tortues {\'e}taient {\'e}lev{\'e}s, mais les densit{\'e}s {\'e}taient environ 24\% plus {\'e}lev{\'e}es {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture qu'{\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur. En 2002, l'ann{\'e}e o{\`u} elles {\'e}taient les plus faibles, les densit{\'e}s avaient diminu{\'e} de 90\% {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture et de 95\% {\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur. Entre 2002 et 2012, la population {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture a montr{\'e} des signes d'am{\'e}lioration avec une augmentation de 54\% de la densit{\'e}. {\`A} l'ext{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture, les densit{\'e}s sont rest{\'e}es faibles. {\`A} la fin de l'{\'e}tude, lorsque les diff{\'e}rences initiales de localisation ont {\'e}t{\'e} prises en compte, les densit{\'e}s {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture {\'e}taient environ 2,5 fois plus {\'e}lev{\'e}es qu'{\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur. Les densit{\'e}s de population {\'e}taient similaires pour les adultes m{\^a}les et femelles. L'{\'e}valuation par p{\'e}riodes a montr{\'e} que la survie {\'e}tait meilleure entre 1979 et 1989 qu'entre 1989 et 2002 (le niveau le plus bas), et encore meilleure entre 2002 et 2012. Le nombre et la survie des femelles adultes {\'e}taient des facteurs importants pour accro{\^i}tre la population, mais la survie de toutes les tailles de tortues, y compris des jeunes, {\'e}tait critique {\'e}galement. Les principaux {\'e}v{\'e}nements et activit{\'e}s entra{\^i}nant le d{\'e}clin des populations {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur et {\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture {\'e}taient notamment le braconnage, les maladies des voies respiratoires sup{\'e}rieures et l'hyperpr{\'e}dation des jeunes tortues par le corbeau commun (Corvus corax). Les autres causes de mortalit{\'e} {\'e}taient les tirs d'armes {\`a} feu, les v{\'e}hicules et la pr{\'e}dation par des mammif{\`e}res. {\`A} l'ext{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture, la fragmentation et la d{\'e}t{\'e}rioration de l'habitat {\'e}taient un facteur critique. Entre le premier et le dernier relev{\'e}, deux processus {\'e}cosyst{\'e}miques diff{\'e}rents {\'e}taient {\`a} l'{\oe}uvre: r{\'e}g{\'e}n{\'e}ration de la v{\'e}g{\'e}tation et des sols pr{\'e}c{\'e}demment ab{\^i}m{\'e}s par les p{\^a}turages et les v{\'e}hicules {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture; poursuite de la d{\'e}t{\'e}rioration {\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture. L'habitat {\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture {\'e}tait de plus en plus d{\'e}pourvu de v{\'e}g{\'e}tation et fragment{\'e} par les routes et les sentiers, et les fragments d'habitat ont {\'e}t{\'e} multipli{\'e}s par 50. {\`A} l'ext{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture, la biomasse de plantes annuelles non indig{\`e}nes a augment{\'e} et le couvert d'arbustes a {\'e}t{\'e} r{\'e}duit, refl{\'e}tant une d{\'e}t{\'e}rioration continue. Ces changements et ces pertes d'habitat ont entra{\^i}n{\'e} une r{\'e}duction du couvert arbustif et des sites pouvant accueillir des terriers, une rar{\'e}faction des plantes dont se nourrissent les tortues et une plus grande exposition aux pr{\'e}dateurs et aux temp{\'e}ratures extr{\^e}mes. Dans l'ensemble, la population de tortues et l'habitat {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur de la cl{\^o}ture semblaient avoir b{\'e}n{\'e}fici{\'e} de la protection apport{\'e}e et montraient des signes de r{\'e}g{\'e}n{\'e}ration {\`a} la fin de l'{\'e}tude. La cl{\^o}ture, le contr{\^o}le de l'acc{\`e}s des v{\'e}hicules et la suppression des p{\^a}turages faisaient partie des mesures recommand{\'e}es pour l'habitat essentiel dans le premier plan de r{\'e}g{\'e}n{\'e}ration en 1994. {\`A} la fin de l'{\'e}tude, la zone naturelle est demeur{\'e}e l'une des deux zones officiellement prot{\'e}g{\'e}es et cl{\^o}tur{\'e}es pour l'esp{\`e}ce dans l'aire de r{\'e}partition de l'esp{\`e}ce. Nous attribuons {\`a} la cl{\^o}ture la persistance de plus fortes densit{\'e}s d'adultes {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur par rapport {\`a} l'ext{\'e}rieur ainsi que les signes prometteurs de r{\'e}g{\'e}n{\'e}ration. Les densit{\'e}s de population adulte dans la zone naturelle {\'e}taient {\'e}galement de 2,3 {\`a} 5,5 fois plus {\'e}lev{\'e}es que dans 16 des 17 zones de protection des tortues (unit{\'e}s d'habitat essentiel) de l'aire de r{\'e}partition de l'esp{\`e}ce.},

  abstract     = {Species conservation and management require reliable information about animal distribution and population size. Better management actions within a species' range can be achieved by identifying the location and timing of population changes. In the Greater Mahale Ecosystem (GME), western Tanzania, deforestation due to the expansion of human settlements and agriculture, annual burning, and logging are known threats to wildlife. For one of the most charismatic species, the endangered eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), approximately 75\% of the individuals are distributed outside national park boundaries, requiring monitoring and protection efforts over a vast landscape of various protection statuses. These efforts are especially challenging when we lack data on trends in density and population size. To predict spatio-temporal chimpanzee density and abundance across the GME, we used density surface modeling, fitting a generalized additive model to a 10-year time-series data set of nest counts based on line-transect surveys. The chimpanzee population declined at an annual rate of 2.41\%, including declines of 1.72\% in riparian forests (from this point forward, forests), 2.05\% in miombo woodlands (from this point forward, woodlands) and 3.45\% in nonforests. These population declines were accompanied by ecosystem-wide declines in vegetation types of 1.36\% and 0.32\% per year for forests and woodlands, respectively; we estimated an annual increase of 1.35\% for nonforests. Our model predicted the highest chimpanzee density in forests (0.86 chimpanzees/km2, 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) 0.60{\textendash}1.23; as of 2020), followed by woodlands (0.19, 95\% CI 0.12{\textendash}0.30) and nonforests (0.18, 95\% CI 0.10{\textendash}1.33). Although forests represent only 6\% of the landscape, they support nearly one-quarter of the chimpanzee population (769 chimpanzees, 95\% CI 536{\textendash}1103). Woodlands dominate the landscape (71\%) and therefore support more than a half of the chimpanzee population (2294; 95\% CI 1420{\textendash}3707). The remaining quarter of the landscape is represented by nonforests and supports another quarter of the chimpanzee population (750; 95\% CI 408{\textendash}1381). Given the pressures on the remaining suitable habitat in Tanzania, and the need of chimpanzees to access both forest and woodland vegetation to survive, we urge future management actions to increase resources and expand the efforts to protect critical forest and woodland habitat and promote strategies and policies that more effectively prevent irreversible losses. We suggest that regular monitoring programs implement a systematic random design to effectively inform and allocate conservation actions and facilitate interannual comparisons for trend monitoring, measuring conservation success, and guiding adaptive management.},

  abstract     = {Human pressure on ecosystems has strongly increased over the last decades and now impacts even the most remote regions. To help mitigate these impacts, it is crucial to designate protected areas in regions that retain a high level of ecological integrity. However, ecological data remain scarce for many such areas, making the systematic design of new protected zones challenging. Following a request from local managers, we developed an original methodological approach to help design new zoning for a pre-existing protected area in a remote, data-poor Sahelian wetland of southern Chad, a vast area rich in biodiversity and exploited by diverse human activities. The method involved first collecting extensive aerial survey data (6252 records) on birds and mammals and then analysing this through a combination of distance sampling and density surface modelling. The biodiversity data, combined with ecological predictors, helped model species distribution layers that were then incorporated with socio-economic constraints into the systematic conservation planning tool Marxan. This approach produced an array of protected zoning options that met three levels of conservation objectives set by experts, corresponding to proportions of individuals from given species to protect in the proposed protected area. Frequent exchanges with local managers allowed the analyses to be refined, resulting in seven potential scenarios to be considered for conservation purposes. Synthesis and applications. In a context of high data scarcity, lack of access and short-term conservation objectives, this combined approach that optimizes newly obtained data via a suite of modelling tools can facilitate identifying and protecting natural areas in regions most in need of urgent conservation policy.},

However, long-term population monitoring data to determine the impact of snaring on wildlife populations is limited. We used distance sampling to estimate wildlife densities and population trends and data collected from ranger patrols to assess snare numbers across two protected areas in Cambodia's Eastern Plains Landscape. We found that the populations of three ungulate species, including the globally endangered banteng (Bos javanicus), steeply declined as snare numbers appeared to increase. In the same time period, the populations of two globally threatened arboreal primates remained similar or increased. Our findings indicate that snaring likely impacts ground-dwelling ungulates whilst sparing arboreal primates. Current ungulate densities are at critically low levels with several species at the brink of extirpation in our study area. We recommend urgent and comprehensive conservation actions to restrict snaring and prevent irreversible wildlife population collapses in this landscape and across the broader region.},

Seasonal patterns of four species of ungulates, namely sambar, chital, nilgai, and wild pig, were investigated and identified as the environmental variables driving the density gradient across two seasons, summer and winter, in the tropical dry deciduous forest of Panna Tiger Reserve, central India. Distance sampling data were analyzed using density surface modeling for ungulates with a survey effort of 518 km in winter and 356 km in summer in a generalized additive modeling framework. We found that season significantly affected the spatial densities of all ungulates, with sambar, chital, and nilgai congregating in summer and wild pig in winter. All ungulates showed a clear seasonal shift to the valley in summer and preferred plateaus in winter. The spatially explicit map outputs draw attention to the seasonal hot spots for ungulates abundance and the species and season-specific roles of environment variables in defining their distribution. These results provide a scientific basis for direct conservation efforts to the spatially prioritized habitats for cost-effective management interventions.},

  abstract     = {Two species of sea lions occur in the inland waters of Washington State: the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) and the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus). Both species breed elsewhere, but they typically move into Puget Sound and adjacent waters of the Salish Sea from autumn through spring. There is a need for information on their current abundance and seasonal use patterns as both species prey heavily on threatened/ endangered stocks of salmon and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus spp.), and empirical abundance estimates of these species are lacking for inland Washington waters. From 2013 to 2016, we conducted 39,399 km of aerial surveys for marine mammals in this area, sighting 255 groups of sea lions. We used a subset of 7,841 km of effort and 165 sea lion sightings made during surveys in good sighting conditions to estimate in-water abundance using line-transect methods. Historical tagging data collected in Pacific Northwest waters were used to evaluate the proportions of time that each species spent on land and conducting dives, and then to develop correction factors to derive total abundance for both sea lion species, providing the first empirical abundance estimates for these waters. We estimated that between 33 and 442 California sea lions were found in Puget Sound/ Hood Canal in different seasons, with nearly 3,000 being found in the broader inland Washington waters in the peak season (spring). Steller sea lions occurred in much smaller numbers, with a peak of 219 animals in Puget Sound/Hood Canal/Strait of Juan de Fuca in autumn (and possibly as many as 600 to 700 in the entire study area). While some estimates suffer from low precision, this study demonstrates that substantial numbers of sea lions use waters of the study area throughout much of the year. Our results provide an important step toward a better understanding of these two species in the inland waters of Washington, as well as their potential effects on protected salmonid prey species.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy of post-translocation monitoring methods is critical to assessing long-term success in translocation programs. Translocation can produce unique challenges to monitoring efforts, and it is therefore important to understand the flexibility and robustness of commonly used monitoring methods. In Florida, USA, thousands of gopher tortoises Gopherus polyphemus have been (and continue to be) translocated from development sites to permitted recipient sites. These recipient sites create a broad range of potential monitoring scenarios due to variability in soft-release strategy, habitat conditions, and population demographics. Line transect distance sampling (LTDS) is an effective method for monitoring natural tortoise populations, but is currently untested for translocated populations. We therefore produced 3,024 individual-based, spatially explicit scenarios of translocated tortoise populations that differed in recipient site and tortoise population properties (based on real-world examples, literature review, and expert opinion). We virtually sampled simulated tortoise populations using LTDS methods, and built a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the population density for each simulation, which incorporated individual-level covariates (i.e., burrow width and burrow occupancy). Line transect distance sampling was largely appropriate for the conditions that typify gopher tortoise recipient sites; particularly when detection probability on the transect lines was {$\geq$} 0.85. Designing the layout of transects relative to the orientation of soft-release pens, to avoid possible sampling biases that lead to extreme outliers in estimates of tortoise densities, resulted in more accurate population estimates. We also suggest that use of individual-level covariates, applied using a Bayesian framework as demonstrated here, may improve the applicability of LTDS surveys in a variety of contexts, and that simulation can be a powerful tool for assessing survey design in complex sampling situations.},

Given these trends, site-based studies are needed to assess how protected areas with differing management strategies enable the effective conservation of wildlife populations. In Tanzania, game reserves are managed for tourist hunting, while national parks are managed for non-consumptive wildlife-based tourism. To assess the relative performance of these management strategies, we here focus on two areas: Rukwa Game Reserve (RGR) and Katavi National Park (KNP). Based on systematically designed line distance surveys in 2004 and 2021, we compared densities and group sizes of large mammal populations (African elephant, giraffe, buffalo, zebra, topi, and hartebeest) over time. Contrary to published ecosystem-wide declines observed in numerous species which considered earlier baselines, we did not detect significant population declines between 2004 and 2021. While these new results showing apparent stable populations do not invalidate earlier studies on wildlife declines, they could indicate a stabilisation phase after declines. This highlights the importance of considering appropriate temporal baselines and historical contexts when assessing conservation effectiveness.},

We demonstrate how heterogeneity creates dependence and bias in mark-recapture approaches to abundance estimation. In comparison, heterogeneity, and hence estimator bias, is not as problematic for distance sampling and mark-resight methods because both techniques estimate detection probabilities based on a known quantity. We show how the introduction of a known number of individuals planted into a study population prior to a mark-recapture survey can reduce bias from heterogeneity in detection probability. We provide examples with simulation and an analysis of motion-sensitive camera data from a study population of introduced eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) of known size with a subset of telemetered birds. In choosing a method for abundance estimation, careful consideration should be given to assumptions and how heterogeneity in detection probability can be accommodated for each application.},

This study focused on Momotus lessonii and Eumomota superciliosa, two potential bioindicators of local and wide scale tropical forest alterations. The study took place in the Karen Mogensen Wildlife Refuge (Costa Rica), a protected area characterized by two main forest habitats where the two species coexist, i.e., primary moist and second-growth dry forest. A distance sampling method was used to obtain density estimates for each species. A spot mapping approach showed an apparent partitioning of the two species at the site. The Kilometric Abundance Index (KAI) and statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the two habitats, i.e., E. superciliosa tended to be more abundant and preferred the dry forest, whilst M. lessonii favored moist environments. The development of arid and semi-arid environments characterized by open areas will probably lead to a numerical increase in E. superciliosa with a consequent expansion, while the decline of moister and homogeneously forested environments will likely affect negatively M. lessonii. We argue that these birds will act as bioindicators of local and global environmental changes, and their monitoring will enable appropriate forest management decisions for conservation purposes.},

Average estimates of abundance in the region over all seasons were 1,058 individuals for Black Sea harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena relicta; CV = 19.25\%, 95\% CI[725, 1,542]), 188 individuals for Black Sea bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus ponticus; CV = 21.67\%, 95\% CI[123, 289]), and 311 individuals for Black Sea common dolphin (Delphinus delphis ponticus; CV = 16.77\%, 95\% CI[123, 427]). The highest estimates for all three species were obtained in the spring. Harbor porpoises and bottlenose dolphins were present in the study area throughout the year, while common dolphins left the region in winter.

Being highly mobile apex predators entails large variations in spatial and temporal distribution. Two vessel line{\textendash}transect distance sampling surveys were conducted in 2017 in the Bulgarian shelf with the aim to estimate the density, abundance and distribution during spring and autumn. Results have revealed a shift from the coastal to offshore shelf of harbour porpoises with marked southern movement. Density of porpoises varied from 1.423 ind./km2 (CV = 25.4\%) in spring to 0.576 ind./km2 (CV = 43.43\%) in autumn. The density of common dolphins was also decreasing, from 0.391 ind./km2 (CV = 36.84\%) to 0.088 ind./km2 (CV = 42.13\%), which was more significant in offshore (0.031 ind./km2, CV = 58.04\%) than in the coastal shelf (0.138 ind./km2, CV = 48.59\%).

However, this property cannot be relied upon to produce unbiased subpopulation abundance estimates when using a single pooled detection function that ignores subpopulations. We investigate by simulation the effect of differences in subpopulation detectability upon bias in subpopulation abundance estimates. We contrast subpopulation abundance estimates using a pooled detection function with estimates derived using a detection function model employing a subpopulation covariate. Using point transect survey data from a multispecies songbird study, species-specific abundance estimates are compared using pooled detection functions with and without a small number of adjustment terms, and a detection function with species as a covariate. With simulation, we demonstrate the bias of subpopulation abundance estimates when a pooled detection function is employed. The magnitude of the bias is positively related to the magnitude of disparity between the subpopulation detection functions. However, the abundance estimate for the entire population remains unbiased except when there is extreme heterogeneity in detection functions. Inclusion of a detection function model with a subpopulation covariate essentially removes the bias of the subpopulation abundance estimates. The analysis of the songbird point count surveys shows some bias in species-specific abundance estimates when a pooled detection function is used. Pooling robustness is a unique property of distance sampling, producing unbiased abundance estimates at the level of the study area even in the presence of large differences in detectability between subpopulations. In situations where subpopulation abundance estimates are required for data-poor subpopulations and where the subpopulations can be identified, we recommend the use of subpopulation as a covariate to reduce bias induced in subpopulation abundance estimates.},

  abstract     = {Distance sampling with line transect method has been applied by many researchers to monitor and observe varied animals and plants with the aim of determining the population density and or abundance of animals. The application of this method has not received the needed attention in Ghana, in particular to monitor, observe, and estimate the densities and abundance of animals and plants in the game reserves of the Mole National Park (MNP) is not without exception and the statistics of these are always reported based on guesses and without any scientific proof. This study has seen the application of line transect methodology in the MNP in which the abundance estimates are statistically determined with both the classical and Bayesian philosophies of statistical approaches. An alternative means of detectability estimation using the total probability concept has been established to enhance the probability of detection of a rare and elusive population of large mammals. In performing statistical investigations on rare and elusive population, it appears insufficient to model from the classical perspective, the use of PRIOR knowledge as seen in the Bayesian context cannot be underestimated. This study proposed that the concept of Total Probability with prior knowledge of animals and plants in line transect surveys must be well embraced, Periodic censuss must be conducted regularly to help in establishing the rate of extinction of units of interest in wildlife and Distance sampling data with line transect sampling methodology need not be analysed using only the classical reasoning. Attention must be given to the existence and availability of prior knowledge of the units under study.},

  abstract     = {Mule deer were first introduced to Santa Catalina Island, California, in the early 1930s and persist today. Other feral, non-native ungulates have been eradicated (goats, pigs) or significantly reduced in numbers (bison) over the past two decades. Effective management of the deer population is necessary to protect the island's biodiversity but is dependent upon reliable estimates of population density and demography. We used annual summer spotlight counts, conducted in eight of the past ten years, to estimate deer densities in the island interior. In 2021, we also surveyed transects in the area around Avalon, the largest town on the island. Distance sampling (Program DISTANCE) was used to model density based on line transect data. Island-wide densities varied from 6.3 to 16.9 deer per km2, with an average of 10.2 per km2, and were positively correlated with July-June rainfall during the preceding year. Most (77-96\%) of the identifiable deer were adults and most adults were does (58-75\%). Deer were spotted most frequently in island chaparral and coastal sage scrub vegetation, the most common vegetation cover types along transects, whereas the use of grasslands and man-made and non-native habitats varied among years. The estimated deer density in Avalon (65.7 per km2) was six to nine times higher than estimates for the interior transects in 2021. The high density of deer near Avalon suggests that gardens, landscaping, golf courses, and intentional feeding subsidize deer numbers in town that have the potential to spill over into the more natural areas of the island.},

  abstract     = {Context Aerial surveys are widely used for estimating the abundance of wildlife over large areas. The failure to count all animals within survey transects is commonly acknowledged and there are many techniques to measure and correct for underestimation. However, the possibility of animals being counted more than once in intensive surveys, which leads to overestimation, is rarely examined. Animals can move in response to observers or vehicles, and bias can occur when animals move before or after detection. Movement of animals immediately prior to and associated with observation processes is methodologically accommodated in distance sampling but bias attributable to responsive movement after observation platforms have passed requires investigation.Aims We sought to investigate potential biases caused by animal movement during intensive helicopter surveys of feral goats, and to quantify the probability that animals are available for recounting because of their responsive movements.Methods Using ground-based behavioural studies simultaneous with intensive helicopter strip surveys of feral goats, we measured the extent of responsive movement, distances and directions moved, and sampling design parameters, and contrasted those with random movements.Key results Feral goats did not move randomly in response to helicopters. Animals within the transect strips, and therefore potentially visible from the aircraft, were more likely to move than those outside the transect. Considerable responsive movement (flushing) occurred between transects and more animals (64\%, n=448) moved towards unsampled transects than towards transects already sampled. Because of the spatial separation of transects, 21\% of goats were available for recounting in adjacent transects, leading to potential overestimation.Conclusions Although most extensive surveys of macropods and other wildlife in Australia account for overestimation in their design, surveys that sample intensively and apply valid corrections for undercounting are likely to produce positively biased estimates of abundance where flushing occurs. Likewise, intensive thermal surveys could be subject to positive bias for animals prone to flushing. This is routinely ignored in wildlife management and research where close transects are used to estimate abundance.Implications Responsive movement requires consideration when designing intensive aerial surveys of wildlife. Randomised transects without replacement or larger distances between transects will counteract recounting bias.},

We present the results of 2 field trials using artificial tortoise models in 3 size classes. The trials were conducted on 2 occasions on an area south of Las Vegas, Nevada, where the density of the test population was known. In the first trials, conducted largely by experienced biologists who had been involved in tortoise surveys for many years, the density of adult tortoise models was well estimated (-3.9\% bias), while the bias was higher (-20\%) for subadult tortoise models. The bias for combined data was -12.0\%. The bias was largely attributed to the failure to detect all tortoise models on or near the transect centerline. The second trials were conducted with a group of largely inexperienced student volunteers and used somewhat different searching methods, and the results were similar to the first trials. Estimated combined density of subadult and adult tortoise models had a negative bias (-7.3\%), again attributable to failure to detect some models on or near the centerline. Experience in desert tortoise biology, either comparing the first and second trials or in the second trial with 2 experienced biologists versus 16 novices, did not have an apparent effect on the quality of the data or the accuracy of the estimates. Observer training, specific to line transect sampling, and field testing are important components of a reliable survey. Line transect sampling represents a viable method for largescale monitoring of populations of desert tortoise; however, field protocol must be improved to assure the key assumptions are met.},

There is a paucity of reliable data on population abundance for these ungulates in the region, which makes it difficult to assess how they are responding to increasing anthropogenic pressure. Our aim was to obtain abundance estimates for khulan and goitered gazelles to inform their management and form the basis of a long-term monitoring programme. Each year during 2012\textendash 2015 we surveyed a total of 64 line transects spaced 20 km apart, with a total of 3,464 km of survey effort across 78,717 km2. Distance sampling analysis provided annual estimates of density and abundance, which were cross-referenced with the results of an aerial survey conducted in 2013. Overall, we observed 784 groups (14,608 individuals) of khulan and 1,033 groups (3,955 individuals) of goitered gazelles during the four surveys. The abundance estimates for 2013 were 35,899 (95\% CI 22,680\textendash 40,537) khulan and 28,462 (95\% CI 21,326\textendash 37,987) goitered gazelles. These estimates were congruent with the results from the aerial survey, which overlapped spatially and temporally with our ground-based survey. Our findings confirm that Mongolia's Gobi Desert supports the largest population of khulan and goitered gazelles in the world, and we provide a critical update on the status of the two species.},

  abstract     = {Accurate abundance estimates of plant populations are fundamental to numerous ecological questions and for conservation. Estimating population parameters for rare or cryptic plant species, however, can be challenging and thus developing and testing new methods is useful. We assessed the efficacy of distance sampling for estimating abundance and habitat associations of the endangered Pima pineapple cactus (Coryphantha scheeri var. robustispina), a rare plant in the Sonoran Desert of southwestern North America that has traditionally been surveyed with census-based methods. Distance sampling (DS) involves measuring distances between focal objects and samples of lines or points, and modeling detection functions that adjust estimates for variation in detection probability (P). Although often used in animal systems, DS remains largely untested for plants. We encountered 105 live individuals along 36.9~km of transects in 11 study plots placed across much of the geographic range of the species, and estimated an average density of 1.47 individuals/ha (CV\,=\,0.139). Compared to values from intensive censuses, density estimates from DS were underestimated by only 2.3\% on average and highly correlated on the untransformed (r\,=\,0.84) and logarithmic (r\,=\,0.93) scales. Estimates of P averaged 0.49 and declined as soils became increasingly dominated by larger soil substrates, and somewhat with increasing vegetation volume and decreasing cactus height. Local densities increased with increasing slope and soil substrate size and decreased with increasing vegetation volume (P\,{$\leq$}\,0.024). Combined with careful survey design, DS offers an efficient method for estimating population parameters for uncommon and cryptic plants.},

With the aim of developing a standardised method of surveying parrots in the rainforests of New Caledonia, we used distance sampling to estimate densities of New Caledonian Parakeets (Cyanoramphus saisseti), Horned Parakeets (Eunymphicus cornutus), Ouv\'ea Parakeets (E. uvaeensis), and New Caledonian Rainbow Lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematodus deplanchii). We carried out surveys in the early morning and late afternoon, when parrots were easiest to detect. To minimise errors associated with estimating distances and flock sizes by ear, we conducted brief searches to locate parrots, then measured their distance from the transect line. We recorded birds in flight and consider these records to be important when estimating parakeet populations. In agreement with existing knowledge on distance sampling, we found line transects to be more efficient than point transects for estimating the density of parakeets. Our results indicate that parrots located beyond 50\textendash 70~m from the transect line have little influence upon density estimates. In addition, surveys on roads are likely to underestimate densities if not corrected for road width. We generated relatively stable and precise density estimates (CV~{$<~$}0.25) with approximately 40\textendash 50 detections, yet additional effort may be warranted under different study conditions. Although we aimed to improve parrot surveys in New Caledonia, our suggestions may be useful to other researchers studying rainforest birds, and can be adapted to suit different species or environments.},

  abstract     = {Estimating the detection probability of small cetaceans using either visual or acoustic surveys is difficult because they do not surface or vocalise continuously and can be imperceptible to an observer or hydrophone. Animals seen at the surface may have lower vocalisation rates, while submerged individuals may be more vocally active. This study aims to estimate visual, acoustic and combined detection probability by using Mark-Recapture Distance Sampling (MRDS) methodology. We used vessel-based visual sightings and acoustic data (based on click identification) collected simultaneously during the ACCOBAMS Survey Initiative in summer 2018 onboard the R/V Song of the Whale. This study focused on small cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea, including the most commonly-encountered species, the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). We identified duplicate events between visual and acoustic platforms using a decision tree based on time and distance thresholds to estimate g(0) (the detection probability on the trackline) for small cetaceans. A total of 30 duplicate events were identified from 107 and 109 events identified by the visual and acoustic platforms respectively. We tested the models with two key functions. With a hazard-rate key function, the g(0) was estimated at 0.52 (CV=21.0\%) for both platforms combined, 0.29 (CV=25.6\%) for the visual platform and 0.32 (CV=25.1\%) for the acoustic platform. With a half-normal key function, g(0) was estimated at 0.51 (CV = 21.7\%) for both platforms combined, 0.29 (CV = 25.6\%) for the visual platform and 0.33 (CV = 23.2\%) for the acoustic platform. Our results illustrate that passive acoustic monitoring can be used as an independent platform in MRDS to estimate the detection probability. Our estimate of g(0) was well below 1, far from the perfect detection commonly assumed for abundance estimation. Without correction for detection biases, total abundance would be underestimated by a factor of two when using both acoustic and visual data. This highlights the importance of using dual-platform surveys to estimate detection probability in order to improve abundance estimates and conservation efforts.},
