title: Training in distance sampling methods
---

Our training in design and analysis of distance sampling surveys take two forms:

### Guided training workshops

- offered online via Microsoft Teams or Zoom

## Current offerings

- Introductory distance sampling
  - [17-28 February 2025](announcements/intro-feb-2025.md) (registration opening in November 2024)
:::

We offer widening participation scholarships for our guided training workshops. See details and application procedures [at this link](scholarships.qmd).

[Email us](mailto:distance@st-andrews.ac.uk) if you are interested in workshops on introduction to distance sampling, camera trap distance sampling or practical design and simulation.

### Asynchronous introductory workshops
- lectures and practical exercise are available online to investigate and review at your own pace.
- [materials](https://workshops.distancesampling.org/async2024-2/) were completely revised in 2024 and cover the following
  - line and point transects
  - assessing and improving precision of abundance estimates
  - introductory survey design
  - stratification and use of covariates in detection function models
  - indirect surveys and multipliers
  - animals that occur in groups
  - double observer methods (for estimating detection probability on the line ($\widehat{g(0)}$))
  - applying appropriate field methods
